  - Can use 'Temporary Chat' feature which won't appear in history tab and it won't keep in record/track.  
  - Can 'Share chat link' or can share our ChatGPT conversation through link --> so that other people can also able to access it.  
  - Can 'Archive chat' or can hide any chat from the main active conversation list or 'Chats' list.

    - Ask anything through voice by clicking on '🎤Dictate' but, whcih actually works like speech-to-text.  
    - Toggle/Enable '🎙Voice mode' to activate fully voice-based conversation only, in which ChatGPT also talks backs with us. It's actually 'Voice chat' or can say interactive chat. But it doesn't keep track or record/history of chat/conversation. So, it's just works like any virtual/voice assistant e.g. Google Assistant or Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri.  
    - Upload or attach images/files to ask a corresponding/related queries or to get summary of any larg files.  
    - Toggle '🖼Create an image' feature to generate image through prompt.

> Pro Tip :
> We can use Emoji for naming the 'Chat Title' e.g. '👨‍💻Coding', '🎼Music research🎶', '🎹Piano learning', so that it will be more visually scannable and presentable.  

In upcoming lessons we will learn how to use the above features.  

🔸 Also, ChatGPT have the feature to updated/improved/refine our reponse if we don't like the present reply by ChatGPT.

#### 🔰Lesson 4 : Get precision/user-focused reply with **CustomizedGPT**  
There is the a huge different between the reply given by the normal 'ChatGPT' and the 'Customized ChatGPT' (CustomizedGPT) which will be more specific to use, because in 'Customized ChatGPT' we are pre-defining ourself first before starting with prompting, so in this case AI will able to know more about us and then give response accordingly to us. (present in Setting's options to enable it || Not Paid feature)  

Through this feature we don't need to explain ourself a no. of times to GPT, it's more like "everything set, just prompting, get reply, start implementing".  

In CustomizedGPT we first need to fill/provide the following settings/details :  
- [ ] What should ChatGPT call you? (means just to provide our name)  
- [ ] What do you do? (means to provide our occupation OR what i want to do now)  
- [ ] What traits should ChatGPT have? (means need to define the level of the reply (ease/professional/lamen's term) or what quality should the GPT reply to us)
- [ ] Anything else ChatGPT should know about you? (mean here we can mention any of our personal extra quality)
- [ ] ChatGPT capabilities. (means enable/disable required AI features)
