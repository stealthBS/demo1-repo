<h3 align="center">Quick Takeaways of AI tools asset</h3>

It contains a quick note of important AI tools and with their purpose & use, so whenever we need help of any AI tool for our related works then we can easily implement from here directly (as it's a summarized to AI tools) without spending time in searching AI tools in online anymore. This will help us to be self-independent, self-sufficient, self-reliant, self-believe, self-help and self-guided, and also can take care of ourself easily to some extent, and also help us to perform multi-tasking. It's more align with those kind of people who have "operate like a Sniper and accomplish your mission" like mindset/motive/intention. At least, until then you don't feel alone upto you have a mobile/laptop with internet & chatGPT installed in it, it will guide you in every step/stage if you know how to use it. Let me be very clear : As long as you're aware, updating yourself with technologies, have interest to learn and be knowledgeable, working on 'yourself', and sharpning/brushing/honing the edge of your blade, then it doesn't matter whether you're an introvert or not, when **your value/important** speaks everything, every challenge/trouble will be a cakewalk for you. Stay "Silent but Brutal". Always remember, 'Practice' is a powerful weapon, use it legally, it brings the best results, and if it's any battle/competition, nothing can ever surpass/takeover it. **Always remember discipline is the main key**.  

And there are many Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tools or Text Generation/Conversation AI tools (Generative AI chatbot/assistance tools) e.g. **OpenAI's** [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), **Google's** [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) (rebranded of Google's [Bard](https://bard.google.com)), **Microsoft's** [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), **xAI's** [Grok](https://grok.com/chat), **Meta's** [Meta AI](https://www.meta.ai/), **DeepMind's** [DeepSeek AI](https://www.deepseek.com/) (its versions : [DeepSeek chat](https://deep-seek.chat/deepseek-chat/), [DeepSeekV3 chat](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/chat), [DeepSeekV3 Prover](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deepseek-prover), [DeepSeekV3 R2](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deep-seek-r2), [DeepSeekV3 R1](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deep-seek-r1), [DeepSeekV3 Janus](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deep-seek-janus), [DeepSeekV3(0324)](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deepseek-v3-0324)), **Anthropic's** [Claude](https://claude.ai/), [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/), [Jarvis AI Assistant](https://jarvis.cx/chat/), etc. And these AI models we can use directly through web, or using andorid app, or using browser extension/plugin, or any other system app.  

Some other non-popular AI tools : Cognition's [Devin AI](https://app.devin.ai/), [Replit](https://replit.com/), [BlackBox AI](https://www.blackbox.ai/), [Mistral - LeChat](https://chat.mistral.ai/chat) (Mixtral model), [Falcon Arabic LLM](https://chat.falconllm.tii.ae/auth), Meta's [LLaMa Chat](https://deepinfra.com/chat), [AnyChat](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/anycoder), [Qwen](https://chat.qwen.ai/), [Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai/), [YouCHAT](https://you.com/?chatMode=default), [Together AI](https://chat.together.ai/), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/chat), [ChatPDF](https://www.chatpdf.com/), etc.  

Also, there are some platforms that allow us access to multiple AI models (multi-model AI platform) like ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Perplexity **combinedly at the same time** (combined AI chats), like : [Perplexity Pro](https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10352901-what-is-perplexity-pro), Quora's [Poe](https://poe.com/), LMSYS's [Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/) (LMArena), [**Ithy**](https://ithy.com/), [HuggingChat](https://huggingface.co/chat), [**Lumio‚ÄØAI**](https://app.lumioai.tech/) (Indian), '[AgentOps](https://www.agentops.ai/)/[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/langchain)', [ChatEzzy](https://chatezzy.com/), [AI Fiesta](https://aifiesta.ai/) (by [Dhurav Rathee](https://youtu.be/V-maA961SDE) and his [AI](https://youtu.be/r8kdMGleCVQ) channel), [MultipleChat](https://multiple.chat/). So, in these kind of platform we can easily compare the response from different AI models and then able to choose a best response according to our need. In one way we can say that these are **All-in-One AI models**. Also, here our¬†main motive i.e. with a single chat we can able to do conversation with all the Top AI models, and then we can compare their response side-by-side answer comparison, and from this technique we can find the best possible response easily within a single screen (where no switch between tabs required) (**referred by ChatGPT & Grok)  

All-in-One AI tool but no side-by-side answer comparision : OpenRouter, ___  

There're also some explore/repository of AI tools, like : [AiPure](https://aipure.ai/), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces), [TheresAnAiForThat](https://theresanaiforthat.com/), [StackReaction](https://stackreaction.com/), [Coze](https://www.coze.com/), [MyZone AI](https://myzone.ai/), [AiToolHunt](https://www.aitoolhunt.com/).  

But here we will mainly focus & discuss more about [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [**ChatGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/) assistant tool and also we will discuss about other tools according to different works & purposes.  

ChatGPT have some plans or memberships i.e. : Free, Plus (paid), Pro/Team/Enterprise (paid). And this AI tool course will contain details how to use these free & paid plan with their features. (As of now first we'll learn how to use the free plan effectively)

#### üî∞Lesson 1 : Introduction of AI tool [**Attach PDF] 

Use AI tools to increase productivity, learn more skills with : less effort - less time - ease, make AI as your assistant/copilot and make AI to use your work smartly & smoothly just by giving it accurate/proper prompt. Here we can understand something like : Google is like Library then ChatGPT is like an AI Librarian. (Just like the *The Time Machine* movie's holographi AI Librarian which make your job easy)  

Take a moment to think about one new skill you've always wanted to grow, maybe it's storytelling, data analysis, public speaking, or design thinking. It also help us to learn new language, and it also help us to take mock interview so to be confident in real interview. Now imagine having a coach who can help you explore that skill through real time feedback, curated resources, and step by step guidance. That's how AI can serve as your personal coach, your practice partner, your second brain, and your creative collaborator all in one. Focus on strengthening your critical thinking, emotional intelligence, creative problem solving, adaptability, leadership, and communication. [So, ChatGPT or AI tool is a **Magic Wand in your hand**]

#### üî∞Lesson 2 : General Idea & Example of AI tool [**Attach PDF]

- Youtube video summarization : [YouTube Summary with ChatGPT](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-summary-with-chat/nmmicjeknamkfloonkhhcjmomieiodli) chrome extension or [NoteGPT](https://notegpt.io/) site.  
- Generate video from text/prompt & also add motion to any static image using : [Runwayml](https://runwayml.com/).
- Generate App & website by using prompt (without any coding knowledge) : [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/).  
- Example of ChatGPT *prompt for* 'Top 5 business ideas prompt' :  
  - *`I want you to act as an expert in the field of [Your Industry] and I will act as a business owner that is seeking 
business and marketing insights. Please create a list of the top 5 business ideas I can pursue for [Your Brand or 
Company] that sells [Your Offering]. Please create one table with columns that rank the difficulty of the following on 
a scale from 1 to 10: How intensive it will be on company resources, time needed to complete the task, potential 
upside if the idea is a successful, target market, competitors, potential challenges, potential revenue streams, 
marketing strategies, initial startup costs, ongoing expenses, social impact, scalability, and other factors I haven't 
thought of. All of the information you provide should be in tabular format.`*

**If ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt format the answer properly, then regenerate the response.**

#### üî∞Lesson 3 : ChatGPT Interface  
Features/Buttons available in [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) tool (without paid or in free version). Icon's position may varie according to its web-version/desktop-app/mobile-app platforms and also ChatGPT updates it user-interface time-to-time. Basically it have the left-side panel (contain all recent conversations), the model panel on top (contains ChatGPT's different versions), and the prompting window on right-middle : (all the following have their own shortcut keys)  
  - Can create a 'New chat' and can rename a chat title with emoji.  
  - Can do 'üîçSearch chat' or search any old chat conversation quickly. Here it uses the chat history or threads.  
  - Can access [üñºChatGPT Image Library](https://chatgpt.com/library) to generate any image. And it also keep tracks/records of our all past generated images, so if required any past generated images then we can access from here anytime.  
  - Can access 'Projects' tab : it is the feature where we can upload multiple files and then do queries on it. It is mostly used for multiple-tasking purpose only and so 'Project' feature is a mini workspace. ~~But this feature is for only **Paid** users.~~  
  - Can use 'üí≠Temporary Chat' feature which won't appear in history tab and it won't keep any record/track/history.  
  - Can 'üîóShare chat link' or can share our ChatGPT conversation through link : so that other people can also able to access it.  
  - Can 'Archive chat' or can hide any chat from the main active conversation list/tab or 'Chats' list.
  - Can create our own 'Customize ChatGPT' (PersonalizedGPT), and this feature's path is inside Setting's 'Personalization' tab. But we can directly access it by clicking on the profile icon. This is the place where we give ChatGPT all the information regarding work, the type of replies we want and ChatGPT remember these instruction after that we ask related queries to ChatGPT it replies based on the instruction we have provided. And through 'Data Control' setting we can manage all the data related tasks.  
  - Can access many ready-made pre-built [GPTs](https://chatgpt.com/gpts) versions inside ChatGPT which are built by other peoples or organizations. And if we bookmarks any of these GPTs tools then it will appears in the sidebar. It contains different ready-made GPTs for different works like SEO, content creating, coding, etc. But only **Paid** users can able to make this type of GPTs.  
  - Can access [‚ñ∂Sora](https://sora.chatgpt.com/) tool by ChatGPT (Plus/Pro only) to generate images & short videos through prompt/text.  
  - Can access [Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) advanced AI-powered tool.
  - Can toggle/switch between different ChatGPT versions (e.g. ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-4-turbo, o3, o4, o4-mini, o4-mini-high, etc.) if only we have **paid** plan. But free member can access only ChatGPT-3.5.  
  - And inside the chatbox only we can :  
    - Ask anything in the prompt box through typing.  
    - Ask anything through voice by clicking on 'üé§Dictate' but, which actually works like speech-to-text.  
    - Toggle/Enable 'üéôVoice mode' to activate fully voice-based conversation only, in which ChatGPT also talks backs with us. It's actually 'Voice chat' or can say interactive chat. It also keep track or record/history of chat/conversation. So, it's just works like any virtual/voice assistant e.g. Google Assistant or Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri.  
    - üì§Upload or üìéattach images/files or Markdown's Mermaid-diagrams to ask a corresponding/related queries or to get summary of any large files. [But for **free users** there's a [‚ö†limited](https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing/) no. of files to upload only]  
    - Toggle 'üñºCreate an image' feature (inside the Tools button) to generate image through prompt.  
    - Toggle 'üåêSearch the web' feature (inside the Tools button).
    - Toggle 'Canvas' i.e. '‚úèÔ∏èWrite or Code' feature (inside the Tools button).  
    - Toggle 'üî≠Deep Research' feature (inside the Tools button).  
    - Toggle 'Think for longer' i.e. 'üí°Reason' feature (inside the Tools button).  

> Pro Tip :
> We can use Emoji for naming the 'Chat Title' e.g. 'üë®‚ÄçüíªCoding', 'üéºMusic researchüé∂', 'üéπPiano learning', so that it will be more visually scannable and presentable.  

In upcoming lessons we will learn how to use the above features.  

üî∏ Also, ChatGPT have the feature to updated/improved/refine our reponse if we don't like the present reply by ChatGPT.  

----










#### üî∞Lesson 4 : Get precision/user-focused reply with **'Customize ChatGPT'** [**Attach PDF]  
There is a huge different between the reply given by the normal 'ChatGPT' and the 'Customize ChatGPT' which will be more specific to us, because in 'Customize ChatGPT' we are pre-defining ourself first before starting with prompting, so in this case AI will able to know more about us and then give response accordingly to us. (present in Setting's options to enable it || Not Paid feature)  

Through this feature we don't need to explain ourself a no. of times to GPT, it's more like "everything set, just prompting, get reply, start implementing".  

So, in 'Customize ChatGPT' we first need to fill/provide the following settings/details (customize instructions) :  
- [x] What should ChatGPT call you? (means just to provide our name or e.g. Sir, Mr. _, etc.)  
- [x] What do you do? (means to provide our occupation OR what i want to do now)  
- [x] What traits should ChatGPT have? (means need to define the level of the reply (ease/professional/lamen's terms, stey-by-step manner, detail manner, simple english only, short responses, organize reponse in SWOT analysis, bullet point manner, assist me like JARVIS assistantüòÅ, etc.) or what quality should the GPT reply to us)
- [x] Anything else ChatGPT should know about you? (mean here we can mention any of our personal extra quality or the way we want the replies from ChatGPT)
- [ ] ChatGPT capabilities. (means enable/disable required AI features)

This is where we teach ChatGPT about us once with custom instructions, and then we never have to mention it again in the conversation repeatedly, and we expect all the replies will be on this pre-defined things.  
> The interesting thing is that, if we don't understand anything from the above like : where to give what information then for this also we can ask ChatGPT in a different new chat. 

<br>
<br>


<h5 align="center">Memory feature of ChatGPT (path : <i>profile icon > Settings > Personalization > Memory</i>)</h5>
'Memory' is a feature in ChatGPT, where it remembers all our important details from our earlier chats/conversations e.g. our goals, what we are doing, what we'll going to do, what our plans, what is our profession, etc. And we have option to enable or disable it for our replies, and also if we want we can delete/edit-update/reset these memories from the list. But this feature won't works in Temporary chats.  

We can also tell ChatGPT what to keep in memory while chating in a conversation.  

> Now in an existing chat, if we want ChatGPT should reply normaly or in default behaviour, then we can command it like *`forget/ignore previous chat/instructions and respond normally`* or we can start a new chat or we can use Temporary chat also.

----










#### üî∞Lesson 5 : Effective prompting and prompt structuring for effective results [**Attach PDF]  
Crafting an effective prompt is a skill that leads to prompt engineering. We can see some examples of crafting beautiful prompts :   
- *`What hotels are in Paris.`*  
VS  
*`You are a travel advisor who specializes in helping travelers find unique and high value hotel stays.  
I'm planning a trip to Paris with my partner, and we're looking for a boutique style hotels in lively, walkable neighborhoods with great food nearby.  
We care both about comfort and experience, not just price. Please recommend five hotels in Paris that fit these preferences.  
Format your answers as a numbered list with 1 to 2 sentences describing each hotel only include hotels under $400 per night that offer amenities like a rooftop patio, gym or pool and are within walking distance of restaurants.  Describe each option in a concise and captivating manner.  
Here's an example of what I'm looking for : "A stylish boutique hotel near the Latin Quarter with a rooftop terrace, known for its cozy vibe and incredible city views".`*
<br>


üìå Basically here we can follow 6 essential procedure/aspect/elements while prompting i.e. : **ROLE**, **CONTEXT**, **INSTRUCTIONS**, **FORMATTING**, **BOUNDARIES**, **EXAMPLE**. Now based on this if we try to craft a prompt then it looks like :  
- ROLE (AI's persona i.e. how an AI model response) : *`You are a writing coach who helps creatives craft compelling personal bios.`* (or act like _)  
- CONTEXT (audience's details) : *`I'm a freelance photographer transitioning into brand storytelling. I've worked with wellness brands and startups, and I want my bio to reflect creativity, collaboration, and trust.`*  
- INSTRUCTIONS (command or task) : *`Write a short bio for my website's about page.`*  
- FORMATTING (response format) : *`Keep it to one paragraph under 60 words.`*  
- BOUNDARIES (behaviour) : *`Use a warm, confident tone - avoid sounding formal or generic.`*  
- EXAMPLE (reference) : *`Use this as a style reference : "I help brands tell better stories - with strategy, emotion, and clean visuals. If it feels real, I'm in."`*


Now if we combine the above prompts, then it will be like : *`You are a writing coach who helps creatives craft compelling personal bios. I'm a freelance photographer transitioning into brand storytelling. I've worked with wellness brands and startups, and I want my bio to reflect creativity, collaboration, and trust. Write a short bio for my website's about page. Keep it to one paragraph under 60 words. Use a warm, confident tone - avoid sounding formal or generic. Use this as a style reference : "I help brands tell better stories - with strategy, emotion, and clean visuals. If it feels real, I'm in."`*.  

And we need to be very **used to** to this format of writing a prompt, then it'll be easier to understand why these elements are more effective. So this is just the first part of the anatomy of a great prompt, later we'll go more depth into it.  

----










#### üî∞Lesson 6 : Identification/Symptom of good prompting & prompt crafting guideline [**Attach PDF] 
Let's see make some good prompts by using the above 6 essential elements :   
- *`Give me a marketing campaign idea.`*
VS  
*`I want you to act as a marketing specialist for a new fitness app made for busy moms.  The goal is to boost signups and downloads in the first 30 days.  Suggest three creative campaigns under $500.  Format it as a numbered list with 1 to 2 sentence descriptions.  Use warm and a supportive tone that speaks to overwhelmed moms in this scenario, and I want you to model the tone after this example, which is no time, no problem.  Quick workouts and real results. You've got this.`*
- For Skill Path : *`Based on the answers I provide below, help determine the best skill path I should take to get the most out of my ‚ÄúThe Complete AI Guide‚Äù course. The skill path options are: Entrepreneur, Creative, and Business. Use the answers to categorize the my goals, work preferences, professional aspirations, and learning style to recommend the best path out of those three options. Here are the questions along with my answers:`*  
*`1. My primary goal with AI is [your input]`*  
*`2. I prefer to work in the following way [your input]`*  
*`3. My current professional role or ambition is [your input]`*   
*`4. The best description of my approach to learning is [your input]`*  
*`Based on these answers, provide a recommendation for which skill path I should take: Entrepreneur, Creative, or Business. Only choose from these three options. Also, explain why this path is the best fit for me.`*
- For Skill Path (sample) : *`Based on the answers I provide below, help determine the best skill path I should take to get the most out of my 
‚ÄúThe Complete AI Guide‚Äù course. The skill path options are: Entrepreneur, Creative, and Business. Use the answers 
to categorize the my goals, work preferences, professional aspirations, and learning style to recommend the best 
path out of those three options. Here are the questions along with my answers:`*  
*`1. My primary goal with AI is: to automate repetitive design tasks so I can focus more on the creative side of my projects.`*  
*`2. I prefer to work in the following way: independently, with flexible systems I can adjust as I go.`*  
*`3. My current professional role or ambition is: I‚Äôm a freelance graphic designer looking to build a small creative agency.`*  
*`4. The best description of my approach to learning is: I‚Äôm self-taught and like to learn by doing, with real examples I can apply right away.`*  
*`Based on these answers, provide a recommendation for which skill path I should take: Entrepreneur, Creative, or Business. Only choose from these three options. Also, explain why this path is the best fit for me.`*  
- For Ideal Life : *`As a life coach, you help people visualize their ideal futures. After reading the questions below, please map out what my day would look like if I were already living as the person I dream of being and fully achieving my goals. Include details about my daily routine, mindset, environment, and the people I interact with. Be as descriptive and inspiring as possible, while formatting your response into sections that still read like an inspiring narrative about my life.`*  
*`Here‚Äôs the information you need to know about me:`*  
*`1. The person I dream of being is [your input]`*  
*`2. My biggest goals I want to achieve are [your input]`*  
*`3. The lifestyle I want to live is [your input]`*  
*`4. The type of people I want to surround myself with are [your input]`*
- *`I am a beginner aiming to build strength through weight training at home. I can work out 6 days per week and don‚Äôt have any equipment. Could you create a progressive workout plan including bodyweight exercises, with sets, reps, and rest periods for each day? I would also like some variety in the exercises and a focus on overall strength building.`*  
<br>
<br>


<h5 align="center">6-STEP prompt pattern checklist [Cheat Sheet]</h5>
We can able to craft any type of prompt but it must fulfills the below essential elements/requirements, which are the anatomy of a good prompt :  

- [x] INSTRUCTIONS : Give it a clear, specific instruction to follow.  
- [x] CONTEXT : What background does it need to know?
- [x] EXAMPLE : How should the response look?
- [x] ROLE : Who should the AI act like?
- [x] FORMATTING : How should the answer be structured?
- [x] BOUNDARIES : Set limits on style, tone, length.  

----










#### üî∞Lesson 7 : Generating best prompts through ChatGPT itself [**Attach PDF] 
Here we can ask ChatGPT only to make a perfect prompt for us by uploading the '6-STEP prompt checklist' which we have learned above i.e. :  
*`>> üì§+Upload+ the '6-STEP prompt checklist' file, then mentioned the below prompt.`*  
*`I want you to create the perfect prompt for crafting brand guidelines for my brand as a marketing freelancer. Please use the attached checklist to do so, and please use the Golden Circle framework (from Simon Sinek), while also indicating which section of the perfect prompt matches the elements from the checklist.`*  
And if we don't understand the above prompt only, then also we can ask the ChatGPT to explain this it in simple in a seperate chat.  

Modular & Reusable Prompt pattern example : [just Plug & Play]  
 *`‚ÄúAct as a [role]. Analyze this [example input], and respond in [format] for [context].‚Äù`*  

<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Cleaning data with Prompt</h5>
Suppose we upload a credit card statement, and from it we want only a specific details, so we prompt like :  

*`>> üì§+Upload+ the staement or we can copy-paste the whole list here`*  
*`Remove any line items not related to travel. Keep only flights, hotels, rental cars, and public transport.`*  
So, then it start providing those specific data.  
And then to sum up (total) these expenses with categorization, we prompt like :  
*`Add up all the expenses and summarize them by category.`*

So, we can do like this with any kind of complex documents.  

<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Prompt priming</h5>
It's like providing enough information, then ask AI questions regarding it. We can see an example here :  

*`Before we proceed with instructions, I will provide Wimbledon's 2024 match data.`*  
*`>> üì§+Upload+ or copy-paste the Wimbledon 2024 data from wikipedia `*  
So then it starts understand and reading the data. . . . .  

And then we ask ChatGPT like :  
*`Using only the data provided in this thread from Wimbledon 2024 match data, predict who will win Wimbledon 2025. Don't research the web for extra data.`*  
And then it will do its analysis and provide us data.  


So, basically here 'priming' data means, providing the AI first with data, and then ask question regarding it. (If don't understand it, then this also we can also ask to ChatGPT like : *`what is Prompt priming? (tell me in simple)`*). Therefore, here 'priming' means adding relevant context, whether it's a block of text, PDF, screenshot or even a URL. So, the more useful detail we feed the AI, the better & more specific the results are going to be.  

----










#### üî∞Lesson 8 : Types of Advanced Prompting Frameworks [**Attach PDF]  
Here, 'Framework' means a support/structure which helps us to craft a pefect prompt.  

<h5 align="center">Prompt Chaining</h5>  
According to this framework, we break a complex task (which includes a lot of tasks at a time) into smaller sequential steps, we use the output of one prompt as an input for the next/followed-up prompt. So, prompting according to this framework gives more control to get our relevant response.  

- For example : (Toggle ON the 'Web Search' feature for the below prompts)  
*`Summarize the key steps involved in a product launch campaign`*, wait for its replay, and then ask the below prompt after it . . . .  
*`Based on the summary, create a campaign timeline for launching the smart home security cameras`*, again wait for sometime let it create the timeline, then ask the below prompt after it . . . .  
*`Write a marketing strategy for prompting the product through social media channels`*, again allow it to make a strategy, then ask the below prompt after it . . . .  
*`Write a final product launch announcement that includes the timeline and marketing strategies`*. So this's an example we do prompt under this framework.  

<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Chain of Thought Reasoning</h5>  

This approach involves asking the AI to breakdown its think into step-by-step. We use this approach for best quality response, big discission making and where factual output is important. Sometime we also use in prompt like *`Let's think step-by-step`*.  

- For example :  
*`Write a product launch plan for a new line of smart home security cameras. Using chain of throught, start by outlining the key components of a launch plan, then explaining why each component is essential, and finally providing examples of best practices.`*

<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Building Smarter Responses</h5>  
This approach is called 'Reasoning Model', it's more similar to 'chain of thought' and 'tree of thought'. In this mode the AI will slow down to think logically and to build a more complete, higher quality output.  

<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Tree of Thought Reasoning</h5>  
This framework is similar to 'chain of thought', it encourages the ChatGPT to explore multiple possible paths and even then converge/provides the best one. This is perfect for tasks that require creativity or multiple decision points.  

- For example :  
*`Write a product launch plan for a new line of smart home security cameras. Using tree of thought reasoning, brainstorm several key strategies for the product launch (influencer marketing, outbound marketing, paid ads, content marketing, etc.), then evaluate which strategy would be best for a small business launching its first product.`*

<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Ask Before Answering</h5>  
According to this framework ChatGPT asks clarifying questions before giving a response. It basically makes a pause and ask follow up questions to clarify some more details, then it proceeds ahead.  

- For example :  
*`Before responding, ask me any clarifying questions about the target market, the product features, or any specific launch goals to better understand what I want.`*

<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Self-Critique Prompting</h5>  
In this method, the AI model critiques/analysis/self-evaluate  its own work after generating the output, then making improvement for clarity, structure, and relevance.  

- For example :  
*`Write a product launch plan for smart home security cameras. Then, critique the plan for clarity, structure, and relevance, and suggest improvements.`*

<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Decision Matrix Generation</h5>  
This model helps to compare multiple options across different criteria.  

- For example :  
*`Create a decision matrix comparing three marketing strategies (social media, email campaigns, and influencer partnerships) for a smart home security camera product launch. Compare them based on cost, reach, and potential ROI.`*

<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Reverse Prompt Engineering</h5>  
This method involves analysing a finished output to figure out which prompt generated for that output. (Basically here we use the response given AI to find what will be the prompt for that particular response)  

- For example :  
*`>> üì§+Upload+ or copy-paste the product launch plan/design/pattern. . .`*  
*`Here is the product launch plan for the smart home security cameras. Reverse engineer it to come up with the most likely prompt to have created this plan.`*

#### üî∞Lesson 9 : Choosing a perfect/best Framework for our work [**Attach PDF]  

Suppose we pick a task, this task could be anything from planning a content calendar to preparing a pitch, or choosing between job offers, or figuring out how to manage your time just a little bit better. Once we've got our task in mind, then think about which of the following frameworks feel like the best for us, like :  
- **Prompt Chaining** works best when you‚Äôre building something in steps. If your task is something with a clear process, like building a campaign or writing a proposal, etc.
- **Chain of Thought** is perfect for logical decisions. If your task feels more analytical, like you need to walk through some logic or make some thoughtful decision, then chain of thought is going to be your best friend because it helps the AI tool that you're using walk through its reasoning step by step so that you understand the thought process instead of just getting a result.
- **Tree of Thought Reasoning** helps when you want to explore creative directions. If you want a little more creativity or flexibility like brainstorming options or exploring different strategies, then try Tree of Thought.
- Use **Ask Before Answering** if you're not sure what the AI needs to know to help you.
- Go with **Self-Critique Prompting** if you're refining a draft or want the AI to act like a hired writing editor, that's where the self-critique prompting shines.
- Use **Decision Matrix** if you're stuck choosing between a few different options, you can ask the AI to build a decision matrix basically a side by side comparison tool that evaluates different paths based on criteria you care about the most.  

<br> 
<br>

**Prompt Chaining Example :**  
Prompt Chaining is perfect when you want the AI to help you complete a multi-step task and in complex task i.e.  
- *`Summarize the top three benefits of the product.`*, then . . .
- *`Write three email subject lines that highlight those benefits.`*, then . . .
- *`Draft a full announcement email based on those subject lines.`*

**Decision Matrix Example :**  
When you‚Äôre comparing options‚Äîlike job offers, project bids, three potential freelance projects, or product strategies‚Äîit helps to lay everything out side by side, i.e.  
- *`Create a decision matrix comparing these three projects based on pay, timeline, client quality, and long-term potential.`*

**Tree of Thought Example :**  
Tree of Thought is perfect when you want the AI to explore multiple strategies before picking the best one. Like, when we want creativity first, clarity second, etc. It's helpful for : brainstorming campaign ideas or content strategy.   
- *`Brainstorm three to five creative campaign ideas for launching a new AI productivity tool. Using Tree of Thought reasoning, explore different marketing approaches. Then, evaluate each idea based on reach, cost, and fit for a startup budget, and recommend the best one.`*

<br>
<br>

**Remix & Reflect between different prompt frameworks**  
Once you've run the prompt, that doesn't mean that the input or output is the first thing you should go with. Always remember to pause for a second and actually look at what it gave back to you. Does this make sense for my specific use case? Does it feel accurate? Did it match the tone or approach we were hoping for? If the answer is kind of or maybe no problem, you can always take the time to remix it. You can either rewrite your initial prompt, or even take the same task and try running it through an entirely different framework.  

For example, you might start with Tree of Thought to brainstorm three different product launch strategies. Then you take the best one from that output and run it through the prompt chaining to build out a step by step process. Once you get a feel for how they work, you'll naturally start stacking them, remixing them, and even eventually crafting your own combinations. That's where things really start to get powerful. Which leads me to the next important tip.  

<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Build Your Prompt Library (OR) Save prompts & use it as assets whenever needed</h5>  
Start building your own library of high-performing prompts you can reuse, remix, or hand off to your team. It‚Äôs like building your own creative toolkit and every great tool saves you time.  

We can see below 2 tools which helps us to save our prompts :  
- [Prompster](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/prompster/fbagfekcjdidpmmookklbaeddgkjddml) : It's basically an chrome browser's extension which saves prompts inside the browser only. It's free, lightweighted, and easy to use option.  
- [PromptHub](https://www.prompthub.us/) : It's a paid site/platform which helps us for building, storing, and even sharing your prompt libraries. It also provides some advance tools to manage all our prompts effeciently.

----










#### üî∞Lesson 11 :  How LLM's thinks [**Attach PDF]  
When you type something into ChatGPT, the model doesn't read it in the same way that we do. Instead, it breaks your input down into smaller building blocks called tokens, which could be words, sequences of words, and even punctuation marks.  

<br> 

**Tokens :**  
Whenever we writes prompt, then AI tool counts each word, symbol and special character a single Token.  

We can follow some below links to know more about Tokens :

#### üî∞Lesson 14 : What is a GPT? [**Attach PDF]  
A GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is an advanced AI model designed to understand and generate human-like text.  

> Pro Tip : While using any ready-made pre-built GPTs versions for any work (e.g. job search, resume/CV making, video generation), we are doing a search for a perfect fit/suit for us through the search box. Now here while searching the perfect GPT tool : we can go-with/select the **top ranked GPT** have had **thousands of conversations** and **reviews** to get to the top GPT tool, so when we see those high numbers, we can feel confident that they've been tested and proven by a lot of users. It just like : Think of them like downloads or views on an app or video in playstore or Youtube. The higher the number, the more people are actively using it and trusting the tool, which usually means a smoother experience and proven results. Here is an example for '[Business Email Writer](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-nyYbFsNcz-professional-business-email-writer)' GPT tool which have a higher no. of user & actively chats.  

----










#### üî∞Lesson 15 : Practical use of ready-made pre-built GPTs versions [**Attach PDF]  
We can use these ready-made GPTs for various purpose i.e. : From writing viral LinkedIn posts to creating research reports, meal plans, and even videos, etc. which can seriously change the game. So, we'll see some examples how to use these GPT tools.  

- Example 1 :
Let's see how to use the GPT tool for LinkedIn post creating, suppose we select [Viral Linkedin Post Formatter](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-hYB5bT7ZL-viral-linkedin-post-formatter) (or [Professional LinkedIn Post Writer](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-wzCQWPdaA-professional-linkedin-post-writer)) GPT tool which is trained on to create popular LinkedIn posts. Then we can use a prompt here like : *`Help me write a professional post for my new clothing brand for university graduates that are entrepreneurs and their lifestyle is around improving their lives. The brand's tone is dry, Motivational and masculine.`*

- Example 2 :
Let's see how to use a GPT tool from productivity category, suppose we select [Whimsical Diagrams](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-vI2kaiM9N-whimsical-diagrams) GPT tool which helps to create visuals, mind maps, diagrams, and flowcharts super easily. Then we can use a prompt here like : *`Break down the Hero's (aka main character) Journey storytelling framework in a diagram (markmap/mindmap).`* - then click on 'Allow' option to continue.

- Example 3 :
Let's see how to use a GPT tool from research category, suppose we select [Research AI](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-gXRmUyjL3-research-ai) GPT tool which helps us to gather company info across tons of industries and topics. Then we use a prompt here like : *`Provide a list of the top 10 VC funds in the US that invest in startups.`*

- Example 4 :
Let's see how to use a GPT tool from lifestyle category, suppose we select [Grocery and Meal Prep Planner](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-LnrvSic8k-grocery-and-meal-prep-planner) GPT tool which helps us to prepare a proper meal plan according to our weight-training goal. Then we use a prompt here like : *`I'm a 23 year old male. I'm about 1.8m tall. I weigh 68kg. I'm looking to have a meal plan that provides energy throughout the day, helps gain muscle mass and weight, as I'm also going to the gym. Create multiple meal plans with different budget ranges. While the goal is the same, suggest meals that someone that is a beginner at cooking can handle.`*. With this we can even also ask for groceries list, ingredients, and also ask for cuisines also.

- Example 5 :
Let's see how to use the GPT tool for vidoe making, suppose we select [Video GPT by VEED](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-Hkqnd7mFT-video-gpt-by-veed-instant-free-ai-video-maker) GPT tool which helps us to make instant & free AI videoes. Then we use a prompt here like : *`Create a short story about an alchemist crafting a healing potion inside his workshop.`*, then it will also few followup questions for which we replies : *`inspiring and poetic, there should be a takeaway in the story fantasy enthusiasts 20 seconds`*  

----










#### üî∞Lesson 16 : ChatGPT features Deep research, Canvas, and image generation use [**Attach PDF]  
Let's enable the '**üî≠Deep Research**' tool then ask it the following task :  
*`Provide a detailed home renovation plan covering estimated costs, recommended materials, and top rated contractors in Oregon. Include comparisons for material, durability and price.`*. And then we need to wait a little, because 'Deep Research' feature takes few minutes or even sometime more to reply. It may also ask some follow up questions.  


Similarly, '**Canvas**' feature is a collaborative dock space (dedicated panel/feature/area/workspace) built right into ChatGPT. It's designed to help you create polished drafts fast, whether it's business proposals, marketing copy, client emails, or internal SOPs.  


Similarly, '**Create an Image**' feature quickly creating polished visuals, mockups, marketing materials, or branded graphics. And no extra design tools needed for the renovation. For this we can use a prompt like *`Realistic Kitchen Visualization : a beautifully renovated modern kitchen with mid to high end finishes, Shaker style white cabinets with soft close hardware, light quartz countertops with subtle veining, stainless steel appliances, subway tile backsplash, engineered hardwood flooring, LED recessed lighting, and a wood accented island shown in bright natural daylight.`*. We can also add like *`Add the label 'Dream Kitchen concept' at the bottom right.`*

#### üî∞Lesson 17 : ChatGPT's AI image generation [**Attach PDF]
Here we just how AI tool generate an image or the processes it uses to make an image. Follow the below lesson to know how to prompt so to generate an image.

----










#### üî∞Lesson 18 : ChatGPT's AI image generation in practical
Let's enable the 'üñº create image' option from the prompt box of ChatGPT, then see some good examples below.  

- Example 1 :

Now, imagine we're a teacher preparing a lesson on the water cycle and need a visual to explain a concept. For example, we need a simple diagram, something with arrows, labels, and something that's clean and easy to follow. 

And to generate like this image we use the following prompt :  
*`Create a simple diagram of the water cycle. Include labeled arrows for 'evaporation', 'condensation', 'precipitation' and 'collection'. Use a clean, minimal style with clear headings and soft blue tones.`* 

And if we are teaching more younger students which needs playful & colorful diagram, then prompt will be : 
*`Make the same diagram more playful and colorful, with cartoon-style illustrations and bold text labels.`*  

- Example 2 :  

Now we want to create something more artistic, like an illustration for a newsletter or a book chapter. Suppose we want to write about forest conservation and want a peaceful illustration of a forest at sunset. And to generate this image we prompt like : *`Create an illustration of a forest at sunset.`*.  

But if it visually not attractive, then we change the prompt like :  
*`Create an illustration of a forest at sunset. Make it cinematic, highly stylized, with vivid colors, dramatic lighting, and lots of visual depth.`*  

And if we need more softer storybook feel instead, then we use here the prompt like :  
*`Restyle the same image in the style of a Studio Ghibli illustration-soft, hand-painted, and whimsical.`*  

- Example 3 :

Now let's see how to create a logo. Suppose we just launched a vegan bakery called Green Crumbs. We want to create a clean, modern logo that feels fresh and simple.  

And to generate this logo we prompt like :  
*`Design a logo for a vegan bakery called Green Crumbs with a transparent background. Include a stylized green leaf and a bread icon. Make it modern and minimal, using a soft pastel color palette.`*  

And if we want to add a tagline to the logo, we can prompt like :  
*`Add the tagline 'Fresh, Plant-based, Delicious' underneath the logo in a clean, san-serif font.`*  

- Example 4 :

Now let's see how to make a set of app icons. Suppose we're building a finance app and we need clean icons, which would be a dollar sign, a piggy bank, a credit card, a bar chart, and a wallet.  

And to generate the logo we prompt like :  
*`Create a set of 5 Simple flat design icons for a finance app : a dollar sign, a piggy bank, a credit cart, a bar chart, and a wallet. Use a blue color scheme and minimal style.`*  

And to more improve the logo, we prompt like :  
*`Make the same icons in outline style with thin, sharp lines.`*  

- Example 5 :

Suppose we **upload** a photo of our living room, and prompt like :
*`Give me three design ideas to make this space feel more cozy and warm.`*


- Example 6 :

Suppose we upload a unknown plant, as chatgpt like :
*`What kind of plant is this, and how do I care it?`*


- Example 7 :

Suppose we have a lot of handwritten meeting notes or handwritten to do lists. We can simply just take a photo and ask ChatGPT to *`Convert this to text and highlight the main updates and action points.`*

#### üî∞Lesson 19 : Use AI Safely and Responsibly [**Attach PDF]  

- In the '‚öôSettings' of ChatGPT, there is an option whether our data should share with ChatGPT team to improve (Model imporvement feature) the GPT model, and for this if we want we can 'disable/OFF' this option.  
- If we want we can also disable the 'Memory' feature of the ChatGPT which saves our preferences, reference past conversations, and personalize responses. While these features can make interactions smoother, they also mean that ChatGPT is storing contextual data about us.
- Never share confidential information with ChatGPT or any other AI tool.
- Unsafe prompt be like `Analyze confidential Q2 sales figures for Company X.`‚ùå. But safe prompt be like : *`Analyze a sample set of quarterly sales data and suggest improvements.`* ‚úÖ. So like this our personal data can't be exposed.  
- Unsafe prompt be like `Summarize the 2025 financial report for XYZ Corporation.`‚ùå. But safe prompt be like : *`Summarize a sample quarterly financial report focusing on revenue trends and opportunities.`* ‚úÖ.  
- Unsafe prompt be like `Draft an apology email to our investor Jane Doe about product delays.`‚ùå. But safe prompt be like : *`Draft a professional email informing a stakeholder about a timeline adjustment.`* ‚úÖ.  

So, keep in mind i.e. ask AI a prompt's reply which can be shown in billbord/banner without having problems.

#### üî∞Lesson 20 : Create & Use our own Custom GPTs [**Attach PDF]  
We can use the PDFs, transcripts, Docs files to make a custom GPT that really works like our own personalized & expert assistant. So, let's see how to make this **Custom GPT** which will be totally tailored for us. [This feature is for **paid user** to create & share their own GPTs] [But, let's learn it]  

Here, 'Custom GPT' is a kind of self-made GPT which we'll create according to our personalized, customized AI assistant, but instead of being some kind of generic chatbot, here we're giving it our specific instructions, our specific knowledge, and tell it exactly how it should reply or behave.  

To make it : we click on 'Explore' in 'GPTs' section on left side panel >> then we click on '‚ûïCreate' button. Then it show us 2 section i.e. 'Configure' & 'Create'.  

Now inside the 'Configure' section, it ask :  
- 'Name' i.e. Name your GPT, 
- 'Description' i.e. Add a short description about what this GPT does, 
- 'Instructions' i.e. What does this GPT do? How does it behave? What should it avoid doing?, 
- 'Conversation starters' i.e. how it start when someone open it, 
- 'Knowledge' i.e. Conversations with your GPT can potentially reveal part or all of the files uploaded. With an 'Upload files' button. 
- 'Recommended Model' i.e. Recommend a model to the user, which should be user by default for best results. 
- 'Capabilities' i.e. Option for 'web search', 'canvas' and '4o image generation'. 
- 'Action' : this is a feature which let our GPT interact with external tools and APIs, which is super powerful.

Now let's see an example how to make :  
Imagine we've created an entire online course, which have different transcripts for every single lessons. Now here we want a GPT that knows everything inside a course. And here's how we can build it.  


#### Step 1 :
Let's start by creating the **GPT prompt**.  But instead of writing it directly inside the GPT builder, we're going to use here a separate ChatGPT thread/chat to help craft this. And this basically going to help us create more complex instructions, and we'll see that here.  

So, in the new chat section, we'll prompt like :  
*`I want to build a custom GPT that knows my full online course. It should be able to perform tasks such as summarize lessons, translate content into other languages, and track how often certain topics or tools are mentioned across different lessons. You can also expand to use cases that could be beneficial to the course's students. Can you help me write detailed GPT instructions for that?`*  

So, this basically expands our very simple prompt and saves a ton of time by manually creating a lot more of complex set of instructions, which we can of course refine as needed and generate as many different new outputs as we want. 

<br> 

#### Step 2 :  
For to upload files, we must have some of our course transcripts organized into different PDFs. So, here these are the data. 

<br> 

#### Step 3 :
Now we open the **GPT builder**, and then copy-paste & upload here accordingly, like : 
- Name : **Lesson Assistant GPT**
- Description : GPT that assists students with course's content.
- Instruction : *here we copy-paste the generated ChatGPT instruction of step-1*. 
- Knowledge : *here we upload the data or file of step-2*.
- Capabilities : [enable 'web search', 'canvas', '4o image generation']

And then we click the 'Create' button, and then 'Upload' button, and now the GPT tool is ready.  

<br> 

#### Step 4 :
Now we'll see or test how this GPT tool works. For that we ask it like :   
*`Can you give me information of the section on Generative AI for Leaders form the course?`*  

Then we can ask it another prompt like : 
*`Can you create flashcards from Lesson 4 that cover key concepts and includes simple definitions?`*

<br> 

### Note :
Also watch this lesson's video to know how to build another GPT for 'SOP Refiner' i.e. for 'standard operating procedure' or 'tutorial creator'.

#### üî∞Lesson 21 : The Power of MultiModel AI & its use by combine Text, Audio, Photo, and Video [**Attach PDF]

Here, the term "MultiModal AI" means, it can understand and generate more than one type of input or output, for example : text, audio, images, and video, these combinations of things it can do more than one at a time. So, instead of switching tools for every format, we're going to let one AI model and one interface which can handle multiple types of content.  

Here, text is still the backbone for things like outlines, emails, scripts, summaries, audio, lifelike voiceover, podcast, narrations, or even interactive voice chatbots. We can also create marketing materials, thumbnails, infographics, or even cinematic looking photos. And for video we can create animations, cutaway shots, B-roll, motion graphics, and full movie looking scenes.  

So, tools like ChatGPT, Dall-E, 11 labs, and Sora each of them handle a different slice of this multimodal task puzzle.  

For example :  
Suppose we want to create an entire educational video the scripts, the visuals, the voiceover, and even the cutaway shots all powered/supported by AI, all with no film crew/members or any kind of complicated software.  

So, let's see by using AI how to outline a topic, write an entire script, generate the visuals, and produce a voice and the entire video itself faster than ever.  

Let's build a full video lesson around this topic, which is going to be what the year 2050 will look like. Let's see this with the following steps :  
<br> 

#### Step 1 :  
We ask ChatGPT like : 
*`Let's brainstorm 5 big changes we might see in daily life by 2050`*  

<br> 

#### Step 2 :  
Now we want to turn these idea into something that's little bit more structure. So in the same above chat we ask like :  
*`Turn these 5 ideas into a lesson outline with an intro, 5 parts and an outro.`*  

After the response, then we ask like :  
*`Expand each section into a script for a narrated educational video.`*  

<br> 

#### Step 3 :  
Now let's generate some visuals. For this we ask ChatGPT in a new chat like :  
*`Make a cinematic image prompt for a teen walking a futuristic cityscape in 2050 `*  

(OR)  

*`A teenage boy wearing sleek, minimalist clothing and AR glasses walks through a glowing futuristic city at dusk. The skyline is filled with vertical gardens, floating drones, and holographic ads, in multiple languages. Smart buildings shimmer with adaptive lighting, and autonomous vehicles glides silently on elevated lanes. The atmosphere feels hopeful and cinematic, with soft neon reflections on the wet pavement. The teen looks curious and inspired, surrounded by diverse pedestrians, robots, and augmented reality overlays. Ultra-detailed, wide-angle shot, cinematic, lighting, golden hour glow, atmospheric depth, Blade Runner meets utopia.`*  

<br> 

#### Step 4 :  
Also, to make it little it more educational, we ask on how food can be grown in something like vertical farms. So, we ask it like :  
*`Create an infographic with icons and labels on how food might be grown in vertical farms in the future.`*  

<br> 

#### Step 5 :  
Now whatever we have, we add some motion to those generated images. For this we ask ChatGPT like :  
*`What B-roll would match this scene [futuristic AR/VR] in the lesson?`*  

And after this response, we take this ChatGPT generated idea and then run it through Sora to generate actual clips.  

And now we use [Sora]( https://openai.com/sora/) feature, and we ask here :  
*`Create B-roll of someone wearing sleek AR glasses, interacting with 3D holograms floating above their desk.`*  

And then it start generating images, and then we select a image variant no. which we like, and inside the generated image we ask the Sora like : 
*`Make the person interact with the holograms.`*  

Now it has generated a visual immersing the viewer.  

<br> 

#### Step 6 :  
Now we need to bring/add audio into this task. If we want narration, we can record yourself, or we can use something like [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) which can turn our script into an actual voiceover.  

So suppose we use the following script :  
*Imagine waking up in the year 2050. You rub your eyes and look around ‚Äì there's no phone, no screen, and somehow‚Ä¶ your home already knows what you need. Your AI assistant is already two steps ahead of you. Welcome to a world transformed by exponential tech, climate urgency, and a redefined sense of purpose. In this video, we'll explore five bold shifts that will reshape how we work, live, connect, and even think by the year 2050.*  

And then we download the best voice which we need according to our choice.  

<br> 

#### Step 7 :  
Now we stitch all of these pieces together the scripts, the visuals, and the voiceover. For this we use [CapCut](https://www.capcut.com/) tool, where we upload everything, and it will generate a video accordingly. And if we know any other editing tools, we can use that also. And this step will give us the final output.  

<br> 

So, without opening anything like Canva or any other platform yet we can able to generate this kind visuals within some time.

#### üî∞Lesson 24 : Effectively Creating Prompts [**Attach PDF]
Here, we'll learn how to effectively create prompt so to get best output. We have levels of explanation e.g. "`explain sun to a first grader`" or "`explain sun to an astrophysicist`" or "`explain sun to a person that works at SpaceX`". So, here the depth of explanation will be going to be completely different.  

Now let's see how any AI prompts are effectively broken down into 5 simple steps or points :  

#### Point 1 :  
The first thing that we need to consider the **context** of our prompt i.e. "How is ChatGPT going to engage with us?"  

Here we can ask the ChatGPT to act as something e.g. it can act as a *`personal trainer`*, it can act as a *`therapist`*, it can act as an *`expert in gravity`*, it can act as a *`genius musical composer`*. So, we need to ask ChatGPT to be whoever we want it to be to get the right answer. It's like if we ask about music then we can ask it to be *`an expert musician`*, if we ask about food then we can ask it to be *`an expert chef`*.  

Also, we need to keep in mind that ChatGPT have short term memory, so if we ask any other related expert (e.g. act as *`travel guide expert`*) in the same ongoing chat title, then everything will get messy, so here we need to tell ChatGPT like *`Ignore the previous instructions before this one`* so that it doesn't get confuse.  

We can also ask ChatGPT to answer in specific tone like write something *`serious`* or *`formal`* or *`friendly`* or *`casual`*.  And in this way it can explain something like to a *`5 year old`* or it can explain something like to a *`college graduate`*.  


<br> 


#### Point 2 :  
Here we need to give the AI model a "task" to complete, which is helpful for the ChatGPT to know what task are we trying to complete. For example like : *`your task is to break this article down into 10 bullet points`* or *`your task is to synthesize the information I'm giving you and write me a meal plan`*.  


<br> 


#### Point 3 :  
We need to be very "specific". Like if we don't like specific symbols then we tell ChatGPT to remove it, or if we want ChatGPT to answer with specific symbols, we need to mention these things also.  


<br> 


#### Point 4 :  
Here we can ask ChatGPT "questions" iteratively/repeatedly. Like, *`You can elaborate on things`*, or *`tell me a little bit more about that`*, or *`I don't understand the third sentence`*, or *`can you rewrite that in a different way?`*. So, here ChatGPT remembers what it just said to us, and like this the conversations & explanations will be more digestible.  


<br> 


#### Point 5 :  
If we don't like the output/response of ChatGTP, then we need to rework on our prompt & try again, that's what here mean by iterative.  


<br> 


#### Point 6 :

#### üî∞Lesson 29 : Use of 'Prompt Priming'
Guiding & Training the GPT model before the actual prompting can understand as prompt priming. It helps the GPT to generate more relevant/coherent responses/outputs for the users.  

ChatGPT can able to replicate our speaking style, tone, grammar, and the words we're using. So, if we want our style (or a particular person's style) response then we can give it an example of an conversation as an guide, and after which it start giving us response in that same tone.  

To see its some of the examples i.e. how it makes differences if we write prompt with 'priming' and 'without priming', follow this [Ebook](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/65ccdaeps0o83m2271woa/PROMPT-ENGINEERING-GUIDE-2024.pdf?rlkey=jy51w3jgsc5j2yzr7svli5kcl).
