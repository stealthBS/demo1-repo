<h3 align="center">Quick Takeaways of AI tools asset</h3>

It contains a quick note of important AI tools and with their purpose & use, so whenever we need help of any AI tool for our related works then we can easily implement from here (as it's a summarized to AI tools) without spending time in searching AI tools in online anymore. This will help us to be self-independent, self-sufficient, self-reliant, self-believe, self-help and self-guided, and also can take care of ourself easily to some extent, and also help us to perform multi-tasking. It's more align with those kind of people who have "operate like a Sniper and accomplish your mission" like mindset/motive/intention. At least, until then you don't feel alone upto you have a mobile/laptop with internet & chatGPT installed in it, it will guide you in every step/stage if you know how to use it. Let me be very clear : As long as you're aware, updating yourself with technologies, have interest to learn and be knowledgeable, working on 'yourself', and sharpning/brushing the edge of your blade, then it doesn't matter whether you're an introvert or not, when **your value/important** speaks everything, every challenge/trouble will be a cakewalk for you. Stay "Silent but Brutal". Always remember, 'Practice' is a powerful weapon, use it legally, it brings the best results, and in it's any battle/competition, nothing can ever surpass/takeover it. **Always remember discipline is the main key**.  

And there are many Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tools or Text Generation/Conversation AI tools (Generative AI chatbot/assistance tools) e.g. **OpenAI's** [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), **Google's** [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) (rebranded of Google's [Bard](https://bard.google.com)), **Microsoft's** [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), **xAI's** [Grok](https://grok.com/chat), **Meta's** [Meta AI](https://www.meta.ai/), **DeepMind's** [DeepSeek AI](https://www.deepseek.com/) (its versions : [DeepSeek chat](https://deep-seek.chat/deepseek-chat/), [DeepSeekV3 chat](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/chat), [DeepSeekV3 Prover](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deepseek-prover), [DeepSeekV3 R2](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deep-seek-r2), [DeepSeekV3 R1](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deep-seek-r1), [DeepSeekV3 Janus](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deep-seek-janus), [DeepSeekV3(0324)](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deepseek-v3-0324)), **Anthropic's** [Claude](https://claude.ai/), [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/), [Jarvis AI Assistant](https://jarvis.cx/chat/), etc. And these AI models we can use directly through web, or using andorid app, or using browser extension/plugin, or any other system app.  

Some other non-popular AI tools : Cognition's [Devin AI](https://app.devin.ai/), [Replit](https://replit.com/), [BlackBox AI](https://www.blackbox.ai/), [Mistral - LeChat](https://chat.mistral.ai/chat) (Mixtral model), [Falcon Arabic LLM](https://chat.falconllm.tii.ae/auth), Meta's [LLaMa Chat](https://deepinfra.com/chat), [AnyChat](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/anycoder), [Qwen](https://chat.qwen.ai/), [Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai/), [YouCHAT](https://you.com/?chatMode=default), [Together AI](https://chat.together.ai/), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/chat), [ChatPDF](https://www.chatpdf.com/), etc.  

Also, there are some platforms that allow us access to multiple AI models (multi-model AI platform) like ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Perplexity **combinedly at the same time** (combined AI chats), like : [Perplexity Pro](https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10352901-what-is-perplexity-pro), Quora's [Poe](https://poe.com/), LMSYS's [Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/) (LMArena), [**Ithy**](https://ithy.com/), [HuggingChat](https://huggingface.co/chat), [**Lumio‚ÄØAI**](https://app.lumioai.tech/) (Indian), '[AgentOps](https://www.agentops.ai/)/[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/langchain)', [ChatEzzy](https://chatezzy.com/), [AI Fiesta](https://aifiesta.ai/) (by [Dhurav Rathee](https://youtu.be/V-maA961SDE)), [MultipleChat](https://multiple.chat/). So, in these kind of platform we can easily compare the response from different AI models and then able to choose a best response according to our need. In one way we can say that these are **All-in-One AI models**. (**referred by ChatGPT & Grok)  

The main motive i.e. with a single chat we can able to do conversation with all the Top AI models, and then we can compare their response side-by-side answer comparison, and from this technique we can find the best possible response easily within a single screen (where no switch between tabs required)  

All-in-One AI tool but no side-by-side answer comparision : OpenRouter, ___  

There're also some Explore AI tools, like : [AiPure](https://aipure.ai/), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces), [TheresAnAiForThat](https://theresanaiforthat.com/), [StackReaction](https://stackreaction.com/), [Coze](https://www.coze.com/), [MyZone AI](https://myzone.ai/).  

But here we will mainly focus & discuss more about [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [**ChatGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/) assistant tool and also we will discuss about other tools according to different works & purposes.  

ChatGPT have some plans or memberships i.e. : Free, Plus (paid), Pro/Team/Enterprise (paid). And this AI tool course will contain details how to use these free & paid plan with their features. (As of now first we'll learn how to use the free plan effectively)

#### üî∞Lesson 1 : [**Attach PDF] 

Use AI tools to increase productivity, learn more skills with : less effort - less time - ease, make AI as your assistant/copilot and make AI to use your work smartly & smoothly just by giving it accurate/proper prompt. Here we can understand something like : Google is like Library then ChatGPT is like Librarian.  

Take a moment to think about one new skill you've always wanted to grow, maybe it's storytelling, data analysis, public speaking, or design thinking. Now imagine having a coach who can help you explore that skill through real time feedback, curated resources, and step by step guidance. That's how AI can serve as your personal coach, your practice partner, your second brain, and your creative collaborator all in one. Focus on strengthening your critical thinking, emotional intelligence, creative problem solving, adaptability, leadership, and communication. [So, ChatGPT or AI tool is a **Magic Wand in your hand**]

#### üî∞Lesson 2 :  

- Youtube video summarization : [YouTube Summary with ChatGPT](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-summary-with-chat/nmmicjeknamkfloonkhhcjmomieiodli) chrome extension or [NoteGPT](https://notegpt.io/) site.  
- Generate video from text/prompt & also add motion to any static image using : [Runwayml](https://runwayml.com/).
- Generate App & website by using prompt (without any coding knowledge) : [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/).  
- Example of ChatGPT *prompt for* 'Top 5 business ideas prompt' :  
  - *`I want you to act as an expert in the field of [Your Industry] and I will act as a business owner that is seeking 
business and marketing insights. Please create a list of the top 5 business ideas I can pursue for [Your Brand or 
Company] that sells [Your Offering]. Please create one table with columns that rank the difficulty of the following on 
a scale from 1 to 10: How intensive it will be on company resources, time needed to complete the task, potential 
upside if the idea is a successful, target market, competitors, potential challenges, potential revenue streams, 
marketing strategies, initial startup costs, ongoing expenses, social impact, scalability, and other factors I haven't 
thought of. All of the information you provide should be in tabular format.`*  
**If ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt format the answer properly, then regenerate the response.**

#### üî∞Lesson 3 : ChatGPT Interface  
Features/Buttons available in [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) tool (without paid or in free version). Icon's position may varie according to its web-version/desktop-app/mobile-app platforms. Basically it have the left-side panel, the model panel on top (contains ChatGPT's different versions), and the prompting window on right-middle : (all the following have their own shortcut keys)  
  - Can create a 'New chat' and can rename a chat title with emoji.  
  - Can do 'üîçSearch chat' or search any old chat conversation quickly. Here it uses the chat history or threads.  
  - Can access [üñºChatGPT Image Library](https://chatgpt.com/library) to generate any image. And it also keep tracks/records of our all past generated images, so if required any past generated images then we can access from here anytime.  
  - Can access 'Projects' tab : it is the feature where we can upload multiple files and then do queries on it. It is mostly used for multiple-tasking purpose only. But this feature is for only **Paid** users.  
  - Can use 'üí≠Temporary Chat' feature which won't appear in history tab and it won't keep any record/track/history.  
  - Can 'üîóShare chat link' or can share our ChatGPT conversation through link : so that other people can also able to access it.  
  - Can 'Archive chat' or can hide any chat from the main active conversation list/tab or 'Chats' list.
  - Can create our own 'Customize ChatGPT' (PersonalizedGPT), and this feature's path is inside Setting's 'Personalization' tab. But we can directly access it by clicking on the profile icon.  
  - Can access many ready-made pre-built [GPTs](https://chatgpt.com/gpts) versions inside ChatGPT which are built by other peoples or organizations. And if we bookmarks any of these GPTs tools then it will appears in the sidebar. It contains different ready-made GPTs for different works like SEO, content creating, coding, etc. But only **Paid** users can able to make this type of GPTs.  
  - Can access [‚ñ∂Sora](https://sora.chatgpt.com/) tool by ChatGPT (Plus/Pro only) to generate images & short videos through prompt/text.  
  - Can access [Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) advanced AI-powered tool.
  - Can toggle/switch between different ChatGPT versions (e.g. ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-4-turbo, o3, o4, o4-mini, o4-mini-high, etc.) if only we have **paid** plan. But free member can access only ChatGPT-3.5.  
  - And inside the chatbox only we can :  
    - Ask anything in the prompt box through typing.  
    - Ask anything through voice by clicking on 'üé§Dictate' but, which actually works like speech-to-text.  
    - Toggle/Enable 'üéôVoice mode' to activate fully voice-based conversation only, in which ChatGPT also talks backs with us. It's actually 'Voice chat' or can say interactive chat. It also keep track or record/history of chat/conversation. So, it's just works like any virtual/voice assistant e.g. Google Assistant or Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri.  
    - üì§Upload or üìéattach images/files or Markdown's Mermaid-diagrams to ask a corresponding/related queries or to get summary of any large files. [But for **free users** there's a [‚ö†limited](https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing/) files to upload only]  
    - Toggle 'üñºCreate an image' feature (inside the Tools button) to generate image through prompt.  
    - Toggle 'üåêSearch the web' feature (inside the Tools button).
    - Toggle 'Canvas' i.e. '‚úèÔ∏èWrite or Code' feature (inside the Tools button).  
    - Toggle 'üî≠Deep Research' feature (inside the Tools button).  
    - Toggle 'Think for longer' i.e. 'üí°Reason' feature (inside the Tools button).  

> Pro Tip :
> We can use Emoji for naming the 'Chat Title' e.g. 'üë®‚ÄçüíªCoding', 'üéºMusic researchüé∂', 'üéπPiano learning', so that it will be more visually scannable and presentable.  

In upcoming lessons we will learn how to use the above features.  

üî∏ Also, ChatGPT have the feature to updated/improved/refine our reponse if we don't like the present reply by ChatGPT.  

----










#### üî∞Lesson 4 : Get precision/user-focused reply with **'Customize ChatGPT'**  
There is a huge different between the reply given by the normal 'ChatGPT' and the 'Customize ChatGPT' which will be more specific to us, because in 'Customize ChatGPT' we are pre-defining ourself first before starting with prompting, so in this case AI will able to know more about us and then give response accordingly to us. (present in Setting's options to enable it || Not Paid feature)  

Through this feature we don't need to explain ourself a no. of times to GPT, it's more like "everything set, just prompting, get reply, start implementing".  

So, in 'Customize ChatGPT' we first need to fill/provide the following settings/details :  
- [x] What should ChatGPT call you? (means just to provide our name or e.g. Sir, Mr. _, etc.)  
- [x] What do you do? (means to provide our occupation OR what i want to do now)  
- [x] What traits should ChatGPT have? (means need to define the level of the reply (ease/professional/lamen's terms, stey-by-step manner, detail manner, simple english only, short responses, organize reponse in SWOT analysis, bullet point manner, assist me like J.A.R.V.I.S. assistantüòÅ, etc.) or what quality should the GPT reply to us)
- [x] Anything else ChatGPT should know about you? (mean here we can mention any of our personal extra quality or the way we want the replies from ChatGPT)
- [ ] ChatGPT capabilities. (means enable/disable required AI features)

This is where we teach ChatGPT about us once with custom instructions, and then we never have to mention it again in the conversation repeatedly, and we expect all the replies will be on this pre-defined things.  
> The interesting thing is that, if we don't understand anything from the above like : where to give what information then for this also we can ask ChatGPT in a different new chat. 

<br>
<br>


<h5 align="center">Memory feature of ChatGPT (path : <i>profile icon > Settings > Personalization > Memory</i>)</h5>
'Memory' is a feature in ChatGPT, where it remembers all our important details from our earlier chats/conversations e.g. our goals, what we are doing, what we'll going to do, what our plans, what is our profession, etc. And we have option to enable or disable it for our replies, and also if we want we can delete/edit-update/reset these memories from the list. But thsi feature won't works in Temporary chats.  

We can also tell ChatGPT what to keep in memory while chating in a conversation.  

> Now in an existing chat, if we want ChatGPT should reply normaly or in default behaviour, then we can command it like *`forget/ignore previous chat/instructions and respond normally`* or we can start a new chat or we can use Temporary chat also.

----










#### üî∞Lesson 5 : Effective prompting and prompt structuring for effective results [**Attach PDF]  
Crafting an effective prompt is a skill that leads to prompt engineering. We can see some examples of crafting beautiful pormpts :   
- *`What hotels are in Paris.`*  
VS  
*`You are a travel advisor who specializes in helping travelers find unique and high value hotel stays.  
I'm planning a trip to Paris with my partner, and we're looking for a boutique style hotels in lively, walkable neighborhoods with great food nearby.  
We care both about comfort and experience, not just price. Please recommend five hotels in Paris that fit these preferences.  
Format your answers as a numbered list with 1 to 2 sentences describing each hotel only include hotels under $400 per night that offer amenities like a rooftop patio, gym or pool and are within walking distance of restaurants.  Describe each option in a concise and captivating manner.  
Here's an example of what I'm looking for a stylish boutique hotel near the Latin Quarter with a rooftop terrace. Known for its cozy vibe and incredible city views.`*
<br>


üìå Basically here we can follow 6 essential procedure/aspect/elements while prompting i.e. : **ROLE**, **CONTEXT**, **INSTRUCTIONS**, **FORMATTING**, **BOUNDARIES**, **EXAMPLE**. Now based on this if we try to craft a prompt then it looks like :  
- ROLE (AI's persona) : *`You are a writing coach who helps creatives craft compelling personal bios.`* (or act like _)  
- CONTEXT (audience's details) : *`I'm a freelance photographer transitioning into brand storytelling. I've worked with wellness brands and startups, and I want my bio to reflect creativity, collaboration, and trust.`*  
- INSTRUCTIONS (command) : *`Write a short bio for my website's about page.`*  
- FORMATTING (response format) : *`Keep it to one paragraph under 60 words.`*  
- BOUNDARIES (behaviour) : *`Use a warm, confident tone - avoid sounding formal or generic.`*  
- EXAMPLE (reference) : *`Use this as a style reference : "I help brands tell better stories - with strategy, emotion, and clean visuals. If it feels real, I'm in."`*


Now if we combine the above prompts, then it will be like : *`You are a writing coach who helps creatives craft compelling personal bios. I'm a freelance photographer transitioning into brand storytelling. I've worked with wellness brands and startups, and I want my bio to reflect creativity, collaboration, and trust. Write a short bio for my website's about page. Keep it to one paragraph under 60 words. Use a warm, confident tone - avoid sounding formal or generic. Use this as a style reference : "I help brands tell better stories - with strategy, emotion, and clean visuals. If it feels real, I'm in."`*.  

And we need to be very **used to** to this format of writing a prompt, then it'll be easier to understand why these elements are more effective. So this is just the first part of the anatomy of a great prompt, later we'll go more depth into it.  

----










#### üî∞Lesson 6 : Identification/Symptom of good prompting & prompt crafting guideline 
Let's see make some good prompts by using above 6 essential elements :   
- *`Give me a marketing campaign idea.`*
VS  
*`I want you to act as a marketing specialist for a new fitness app made for busy moms.  The goal is to boost signups and downloads in the first 30 days.  Suggest three creative campaigns under $500.  Format it as a numbered list with 1 to 2 sentence descriptions.  Use warm and a supportive tone that speaks to overwhelmed moms in this scenario, and I want you to model the tone after this example, which is no time, no problem.  Quick workouts and real results. You've got this.`*
- For Skill Path : *`Based on the answers I provide below, help determine the best skill path I should take to get the most out of my ‚ÄúThe Complete AI Guide‚Äù course. The skill path options are: Entrepreneur, Creative, and Business. Use the answers to categorize the my goals, work preferences, professional aspirations, and learning style to recommend the best path out of those three options. Here are the questions along with my answers:`*  
*`1. My primary goal with AI is [your input]`*  
*`2. I prefer to work in the following way [your input]`*  
*`3. My current professional role or ambition is [your input]`*   
*`4. The best description of my approach to learning is [your input]`*  
*`Based on these answers, provide a recommendation for which skill path I should take: Entrepreneur, Creative, or Business. Only choose from these three options. Also, explain why this path is the best fit for me.`*
- For Skill Path (sample) : *`Based on the answers I provide below, help determine the best skill path I should take to get the most out of my 
‚ÄúThe Complete AI Guide‚Äù course. The skill path options are: Entrepreneur, Creative, and Business. Use the answers 
to categorize the my goals, work preferences, professional aspirations, and learning style to recommend the best 
path out of those three options. Here are the questions along with my answers:`*  
*`1. My primary goal with AI is: to automate repetitive design tasks so I can focus more on the creative side of my projects.`*  
*`2. I prefer to work in the following way: independently, with flexible systems I can adjust as I go.`*  
*`3. My current professional role or ambition is: I‚Äôm a freelance graphic designer looking to build a small creative agency.`*  
*`4. The best description of my approach to learning is: I‚Äôm self-taught and like to learn by doing, with real examples I can apply right away.`*  
*`Based on these answers, provide a recommendation for which skill path I should take: Entrepreneur, Creative, or Business. Only choose from these three options. Also, explain why this path is the best fit for me.`*  
- For Ideal Life : *`As a life coach, you help people visualize their ideal futures. After reading the questions below, please map out what my day would look like if I were already living as the person I dream of being and fully achieving my goals. Include details about my daily routine, mindset, environment, and the people I interact with. Be as descriptive and inspiring as possible, while formatting your response into sections that still read like an inspiring narrative about my life.`*  
*`Here‚Äôs the information you need to know about me:`*  
*`1. The person I dream of being is [your input]`*  
*`2. My biggest goals I want to achieve are [your input]`*  
*`3. The lifestyle I want to live is [your input]`*  
*`4. The type of people I want to surround myself with are [your input]`*
- *`I am a beginner aiming to build strength through weight training at home. I can work out 6 days per week and don‚Äôt have any equipment. Could you create a progressive workout plan including bodyweight exercises, with sets, reps, and rest periods for each day? I would also like some variety in the exercises and a focus on overall strength building.`*  
<br>
<br>


<h5 align="center">6-STEP prompt pattern checklist [Cheat Sheet]</h5>
We can able to craft any type of prompt but it must fulfills the below essential elements/requirements, which are the anatomy of a good prompt :  

- [x] INSTRUCTIONS : Give it a clear, specific instruction to follow.  
- [x] CONTEXT : What background does it need to know?
- [x] EXAMPLE : How should the response look?
- [x] ROLE : Who should the AI act like?
- [x] FORMATTING : How should the answer be structured?
- [x] BOUNDRIES : Set limits on style, tone, length.  

----










#### üî∞Lesson 7 :  . . . . . . .
Here we can ask ChatGPT only to make a perfect prompt for us by uploading the '6-STEP prompt checklist' which we have learned above i.e. :  
*`>> üì§+Upload+ the '6-STEP prompt checklist' file, then mentioned the below prompt.`*  
*`I want you to create the perfect prompt for crafting brand guidelines for my brand as a marketing freelancer. Please use the attached checklist to do so, and please use the Golden Circle framework (from Simon Sinek), while also indicating which section of the perfect prompt matches the elements from the checklist.`*  
And if we don't understand the above prompt only, then also we can ask the ChatGPT to explain this it in simple in a seperate chat.  

Modular & Reusable Prompt pattern example : [just Plug & Play]  
 *`‚ÄúAct as a [role]. Analyze this [example input], and respond in [format] for [context].‚Äù`*  

<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Cleaning data with Prompt</h5>
Suppose we upload a credit card statement, and from it we want only a specific details, so we prompt like :  

*`>> üì§+Upload+ the staement or we can copy-paste the whole list here`*  
*`Remove any line items not related to travel. Keep only flights, hotels, rental cars, and public transport.`*  
So, then it start providing those specific data.  
And then to sum up (total) these expenses with catogorization, we prompt like :  
*`Add up all the expenses and summarize them by category.`*

So, we can do like this with any kind of complex documents.  

<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Prompt priming</h5>
It like providing enough information, then ask AI questions regarding it. We can see an example here :  

*`Before we proceed with instructions, I will provide Wimbledon's 2024 match data.`*  
*`>> üì§+Upload+ or copy-paste the Wimbledon 2024 data from wikipedia `*  
So then it starts understand and reading the data. . . . .  

And then we aks ChatGPT like :  
*`Using only the data provided in this thread from Wimbledon 2024 match data, predict who will win Wimbledon 2025. Don't research the web for extra data.`*  
And then it will do its analysis and provide us data.  


So, basically here 'priming' data means, providing the AI first with data, and then ask question regarding it. (If don't understand it, then this also we can also to ChatGPT like : *`what is Prompt priming? (tell me in simple)`*)  

----










#### üî∞Lesson 8 : Prompt Chaining  
Here we are create a type of prompt which includes a lot of tasks at a time, but we have asked it to AI in a sequence manner or in a step-by-step manner. It will be going to include a whole task e.g. about business and its marketing, etc.  

For this kinds of tasks, we often include something something like below :  

- *`Let's think step-by-step. . . .`*  
- *`Before responding, ask me any clarifying questions about the target market, the product features, or any specific launch goals to better understand what I want.`* [Ask Before 
Answering]  
- *`Write a product launch plan for smart home security cameras. Then, critique the plan for clarity, structure, and relevance, and suggest improvements.`*
- *`Create a decision matrix comparing three marketing strategies (social media, email campaigns, and influencer partnerships) for a smart home security camera product launch. Compare them based on cost, reach, and potential ROI.`*


<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Reverse Prompt Engineering</h5>  
Basically here we use the response given AI to find what will be the prompt for that particular response.  

For example :  
*`>> üì§+Upload+ or copy-paste the product lauch plan/design/pattern. . .`*  
*`Here is the product launch plan for the smart home security cameras. Reverse engineer it to come up with the most likely prompt to have created this plan.`*  

----










#### üî∞Lesson 9 :  . . . .   
**Prompt Chaining Example :**  
Prompt Chaining is perfect when you want the AI to help you complete a multi-step task i.e.  
- *`Summarize the top three benefits of the product.`*
- *`Write three email subject lines that highlight those benefits.`*
- *`Draft a full announcement email based on those subject lines.`*

**Decision Matrix Example :**  
When you‚Äôre comparing options‚Äîlike job offers, project bids, or product strategies‚Äîit helps to lay everything out side by side, i.e.  
- *`Create a decision matrix comparing these three projects based on pay, timeline, client quality, and long-term potential.`*

**Tree of Thought Example**  
Tree of Thought is perfect when you want the AI to explore multiple strategies before picking the best one. Like, when we want creativity first, clarity second, i.e.  
- *`Brainstorm three to five creative campaign ideas for launching a new AI productivity tool. Using Tree of Thought reasoning, explore different marketing approaches. Then, evaluate each idea based on reach, cost, and fit for a startup budget, and recommend the best one.`*


<br>
<br>

<h5 align="center">Build Your Prompt Library (OR) Save prompts & use it as assets whenever needed</h5>  
Start building your own library of high-performing prompts you can reuse, remix, or hand off to your team. It‚Äôs like building your own creative toolkit‚Äîand every 
great tool saves you time.  

We can see below 2 tools which helps us to save our prompts :  
- [Prompster](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/prompster/fbagfekcjdidpmmookklbaeddgkjddml) : It's basically an chrome browser's extension which saves prompts inside the browser only. It's free, lightweighted, and easy to use option.  
- [PromptHub](https://www.prompthub.us/) : It's a paid site/platform which helps us for building, storing, and even sharing your prompt libraries. It also porvides some advance tools to manage all our prompts effeciently.

#### üî∞Lesson 14 : What is a GPT?  
A GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is an advanced AI model designed to understand and generate human-like text.  

> Pro Tip : While using any ready-made pre-built GPTs versions for any work (e.g. job search, resume/CV making, video generation), we are doing a search for a perfect fit/suit for us through the search box. Now here while searching the perfect GPT tool : we can go-with/select the **top ranked GPT** have had **thousands of conversations** and **reviews** to get to the top GPT tool, so when we see those high numbers, we can feel confident that they've been tested and proven by a lot of users. It just like : Think of them like downloads or views on an app or video in playstore or Youtube. The higher the number, the more people are actively using it and trusting the tool, which usually means a smoother experience and proven results. Here is an example for '[Business Email Writer](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-nyYbFsNcz-professional-business-email-writer)' GPT tool which have a higher no. of user & actively chats.

#### üî∞Lesson 15 : Practical use of ready-made pre-built GPTs versions  
We can use these ready-made GPTs for various purpose i.e. : From writing viral LinkedIn posts to creating research reports, meal plans, and even videos, etc. which can seriously change the game. So, we'll see some examples how to use these GPT tools.  

- Example 1 :
Let's see how to use the GPT tool for LinkedIn post creating, suppose we select [Viral Linkedin Post Formatter](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-hYB5bT7ZL-viral-linkedin-post-formatter) (or [Professional LinkedIn Post Writer](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-wzCQWPdaA-professional-linkedin-post-writer)) GPT tool which is trained on to create popular LinkedIn posts. Then we can use a prompt here like : *`Help me write a professional post for my new clothing brand for university graduates that are entrepreneurs and their lifestyle is around improving their lives. The brand's tone is dry, Motivational and masculine.`*

- Example 2 :
Let's see how to use a GPT tool from productivity catogory, suppose we select [Whimsical Diagrams](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-vI2kaiM9N-whimsical-diagrams) GPT tool which helps to create visuals, mind maps, diagrams, and flowcharts super easily. Then we can use a prompt here like : *`Break down the Hero's Journey storytelling framework in a diagram (markmap/mindmap).`* - then click on 'Allow' option to continue.

- Example 3 :
Let's see how to use a GPT tool from research catogory, suppose we select [Research AI](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-gXRmUyjL3-research-ai) GPT tool which helps us to gather company info across tons of industries and topics. Then we use a prompt here like : *`Provide a list of the top 10 VC funds in the US that invest in startups.`*

- Example 4 :
Let's see how to use a GPT tool from lifestyle catogory, suppose we select [Grocery and Meal Prep Planner](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-LnrvSic8k-grocery-and-meal-prep-planner) GPT tool which helps us to prepare a proper meal plan according to our weight-training goal. Then we use a prompt here like : *`I'm a 23 year old male. I'm about 1.8m tall. I weigh 68kg. I'm looking to have a meal plan that provides energy throughout the day, helps gain muscle mass and weight, as I'm also going to the gym. Create multiple meal plans with different budget ranges. While the goal is the same, suggest meals that someone that is a beginner at cooking can handle.`*. With this we can even also for groceries list, ingredients, and also ask for cuisines also.

- Example 5 :
Let's see how to use the GPT tool for vidoe making, suppose we select [Video GPT by VEED](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-Hkqnd7mFT-video-gpt-by-veed-instant-free-ai-video-maker) GPT tool which helps us to make instant & free AI videoes. Then we use a prompt here like : *`Create a short story about an alchemist crafting a healing potion inside his workshop.`*, then it will also few followup questions for which we replies : *`inspiring and poetic, there should be a takeaway in the story fantasy enthusiasts 20 seconds`*  

----










#### üî∞Lesson 16 : ChatGPT features Deep research, Canvas, and image generation use  
Let's enable the '**üî≠Deep Research**' tool then ask it the following task :  
*`Provide a detailed home renovation plan covering estimated costs, recommended materials, and top rated contractors in Oregon. Include comparisons for material, durability and price.`*. And then we need to wait a little, because 'Deep Research' feature few minutes to reply. It may also ask some follow up questions.  


Similarly, '**Canvas**' feature is a collaborative dock space built right into ChatGPT. It's designed to help you create polished drafts fast, whether it's business proposals, marketing copy, client emails, or internal SOPs.  


Similarly, '**Create an Image**' feature quickly creating polished visuals, mockups, marketing materials, or branded graphics. And no extra design tools needed for the renovation. For this we can use a prompt like *`Realistic Kitchen Visualization : a beautifully renovated modern kitchen with mid to high end finishes, Shaker style white cabinets with soft close hardware, light quartz countertops with subtle veining, stainless steel appliances, subway tile backsplash, engineered hardwood flooring, LED recessed lighting, and a wood accented island shown in bright natural daylight.`*. We can also add like *`Add the label 'Dream Kitchen concept' at the bottom right.`*

#### üî∞Lesson 18 : ChatGPT's AI image generation  
Let's enable the 'üñº create image' option from the prompt box of ChatGPT, then see some good examples below.  

- Example 1 :

Now, imagine we're a teacher preparing a lesson on the water cycle and need a visual to explain a concept. For example, we need a simple diagram, something with arrows, labels, and something that's clean and easy to follow. 

And to generate like this image we use the following pormpt :  
*`Create a simple diagram of the water cycle. Include labeled arrows for 'evaporation', 'condensation', 'precipitation' and 'collection'. Use a clean, minimal style with clear headings and soft blue tones.`* 

And if we are teaching more younger students which needs playful & colorful diagram, then prompt will be : 
*`Make the same diagram more playful and colorful, with cartoon-style illustrations and bold text labels.`*  

- Example 2 :  

Now we want to create something more artistic, like an illustration for a newsletter or a book chapter. Suppose we want to write about forest conservation and want a peaceful illustration of a forest at sunset. And to generate this image we prompt like : *`Create an illustration of a forest at sunset.`*.  

But if it visually not attractive, then we change the prompt like :  
*`Create an illustration of a forest at sunset. Make it cinematic, higly stylized, with vivid colors, dramatic lighting, and lots of visual depth.`*  

And if we need more softer storybook feel instead, then we use here the prompt like :  
*`Restyle the same image in the style of a Studio Ghibli illustration-soft, hand-painted, and whimsical.`*  

- Example 3 :

Now let's see how to create a logo. Suppose we just launched a vegan bakery called Green Crumbs. We want to create a clean, modern logo that feels fresh and simple.  

And to generate this logo we prompt like :  
*`Design a logo for a vegan bakery called Green Crumbs with a transparent background. Include a stylized green leaf and a bread icon. Make it modern and minimal, using a soft pastel color palette.`*  

And if we want to add a tagline to the logo, we can prompt like :  
*`Add the tagline 'Fresh, Plant-based, Delicious' underneath the logo in a clean, san-serif font.`*  

- Example 4 :

Now let's see how to make a set of app icons. Suppose we're building a finance app and we need clean icons, which would be a dollar sign, a piggy bank, a credit card, a bar chart, and a wallet.  

And to generate the logo we prompt like :  
*`Create a set of 5 Simple flat design icons for a finance app : a dollar sign, a piggy bank, a credit cart, a bar chart, and a wallet. Use a blue color scheme and minimal style.`*  

And to more improve the logo, we prompt like :  
*`Make the same icons in outline style with thin, sharp lines.`*  

- Example 5 :

Suppose we **upload** a photo of our living room, and prompt like :
*`Give me three design ideas to make this space feel more cozy and warm.`*


- Example 6 :

Suppose we upload a unknown plant, as chatgpt like :
*`What kind of plant is this, and how do I care it?`*


- Example 7 :

Suppose we have a lot of handwritten meeting notes or handwritten to do lists. We can simply just take a photo and ask ChatGPT to *`Convert this to text and highlight the main updates and action points.`*

----










#### üî∞Lesson 19 : Use AI Safely and Responsibly  

- In the '‚öôSettings' of ChatGPT, there is an option whether our data should share with ChatGPT team to improve (Model imporvement feature) the GPT model, and for this if we want we can 'disable/OFF' this option.  
- If we want we can also disable the 'Memory' feature of the ChatGPT which saves our preferences, reference past conversations, and personalize responses. While these features can make interactions smoother, they also mean that ChatGPT is storing contextual data about us.
- Never share confidential information with ChatGPT or any other AI tool.
- Unsafe prompt be like `Analyze confidential Q2 sales figures for Company X.`‚ùå. But safe prompt be like : *`Analyze a sample set of quarterly sales data and suggest improvements.`* ‚úÖ. So like this our personal data can't be exposed.  
- Unsafe prompt be like `Summarize the 2025 financial report for XYZ Corporation.`‚ùå. But safe prompt be like : *`Summarize a sample quarterly financial report focusing on revenue trends and opportunities.`* ‚úÖ.  
- Unsafe prompt be like `Draft an apology email to our investor Jane Doe about product delays.`‚ùå. But safe prompt be like : *`Draft a professional email informing a stakeholder about a timeline adjustment.`* ‚úÖ.  

So, keep in mind i.e. ask AI a prompt's reply which can be shown in billbord/banner without having problems.
