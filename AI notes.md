<h3 align="center">Quick Takeaways of AI tools asset</h3>

It contains a quick note of important AI tools and with their purpose & use, so whenever we need help of any AI tool for our related works then we can easily implement from here (as it's a summarized to AI tools) without spending time in searching AI tools in online anymore. This will help us to be self-independent, self-sufficient, self-reliant and self-believe, can take care of ourself easily to some extent, and also help us to perform multi-tasking. At least, until then you don't feel alone up to you have a mobile/laptop with internet & chatGPT installed in it, it will guide you if you know how to use it.  

And there are many Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tools or Text Generation/Conversation AI tools (Generative AI chatbot/assistance tools) e.g. **OpenAI's** [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), **Google's** [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) (rebranded of Google's Bard), **Microsoft's** [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), **xAI's** [Grok](https://grok.com/), **Meta's** [Meta AI](https://www.meta.ai/), **DeepMind's** [DeepSeek AI](https://www.deepseek.com/) (its versions : [DeepSeek chat](https://deep-seek.chat/deepseek-chat/), [DeepSeekV3 chat](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/chat), [DeepSeekV3 Prover](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deepseek-prover), [DeepSeekV3 R2](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deep-seek-r2), [DeepSeekV3 R1](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deep-seek-r1), [DeepSeekV3 Janus](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deep-seek-janus), [DeepSeekV3(0324)](https://www.deepseekv3.net/en/deepseek-v3-0324)), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/), [Jarvis AI Assistant](https://jarvis.cx/chat/), etc. 

But here we will mainly focus & discuss more about [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [**ChatGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/) assistant tool and also we will discuss about other tools according to different works & purposes.  

ChatGPT have some plans or memberships i.e. : Free, Plus (paid), Pro/Team/Enterprise (paid). And this AI tool course will contain details how to use these free & paid plan with their features. (As of now first we'll learn how to use the free plan effectively)

#### 🔰Lesson 2 :  

- Youtube video summarization : [YouTube Summary with ChatGPT](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-summary-with-chat/nmmicjeknamkfloonkhhcjmomieiodli) chrome extension or [NoteGPT](https://notegpt.io/) site.  
- Generate video from text/prompt & also add motion to any static image using : [Runwayml](https://runwayml.com/).
- Generate App & website by using prompt (without any coding knowledge) : [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/).  
- Example of ChatGPT *prompt for* 'Top 5 business ideas prompt' :  
  - *`I want you to act as an expert in the field of [Your Industry] and I will act as a business owner that is seeking 
business and marketing insights. Please create a list of the top 5 business ideas I can pursue for [Your Brand or 
Company] that sells [Your Offering]. Please create one table with columns that rank the difficulty of the following on 
a scale from 1 to 10: How intensive it will be on company resources, time needed to complete the task, potential 
upside if the idea is a successful, target market, competitors, potential challenges, potential revenue streams, 
marketing strategies, initial startup costs, ongoing expenses, social impact, scalability, and other factors I haven't 
thought of. All of the information you provide should be in tabular format.`* **If ChatGPT doesn’t format the answer properly, then regenerate the response.**

#### 🔰Lesson 3 : ChatGPT Interface  
Features/Buttons available in [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) tool (without paid or in free version). Icon's position may varie according to its web-version/desktop-app/mobile-app platforms. Basically it have the left-side panel, the model panel on top (contains ChatGPT's different versions), and the prompting window on right-middle : (all the following have their own shortcut keys)  
  - Can create a 'New chat' and can rename a chat title with emoji.  
  - Can do '🔍Search chat' or search any old chat conversation quickly. Here it uses the chat history or threads.  
  - Can access [🖼ChatGPT Image Library](https://chatgpt.com/library) to generate any image. And it also keep tracks/records of our all past generated images, so if required any past generated images then we can access from here anytime.  
  - Can access 'Projects' tab : it is the feature where we can upload multiple files and then do queries on it. It is mostly used for multiple-tasking purpose only. But this feature is for only **Paid** users.  
  - Can use '💭Temporary Chat' feature which won't appear in history tab and it won't keep any record/track/history.  
  - Can '🔗Share chat link' or can share our ChatGPT conversation through link : so that other people can also able to access it.  
  - Can 'Archive chat' or can hide any chat from the main active conversation list/tab or 'Chats' list.
  - Can create our own 'Customize ChatGPT' (PersonalizedGPT), and this feature's path is inside Setting's 'Personalization' tab. But we can directly access it by clicking on the profile icon.  
  - Can access many ready-made pre-built [GPTs](https://chatgpt.com/gpts) versions inside ChatGPT which are built by other peoples or organizations. And if we bookmarks any of these GPTs tools then it will appears in the sidebar. It contains different ready-made GPTs for different works like SEO, content creating, coding, etc. But only **Paid** users can able to make this type of GPTs.  
  - Can access [▶Sora](https://sora.chatgpt.com/) tool by ChatGPT (Plus/Pro only) to generate images & short videos through prompt/text.  
  - Can access [Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) advanced AI-powered tool.
  - Can toggle/switch between different ChatGPT versions (e.g. ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-4-turbo, o3, o4, o4-mini, o4-mini-high, etc.) if only we have **paid** plan. But free member can access only ChatGPT-3.5.  
  - And inside the chatbox only we can :  
    - Ask anything in the prompt box through typing.  
    - Ask anything through voice by clicking on '🎤Dictate' but, which actually works like speech-to-text.  
    - Toggle/Enable '🎙Voice mode' to activate fully voice-based conversation only, in which ChatGPT also talks backs with us. It's actually 'Voice chat' or can say interactive chat. It also keep track or record/history of chat/conversation. So, it's just works like any virtual/voice assistant e.g. Google Assistant or Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri.  
    - 📤Upload or 📎attach images/files to ask a corresponding/related queries or to get summary of any large files. [But for **free users** there's a [⚠limited](https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing/) files to upload only]  
    - Toggle '🖼Create an image' feature (inside the Tools button) to generate image through prompt.  
    - Toggle '🌐Search the web' feature (inside the Tools button).
    - Toggle 'Canvas' i.e. '✏️Write or Code' feature (inside the Tools button).  
    - Toggle '🔭Deep Research' feature (inside the Tools button).  
    - Toggle 'Think for longer' i.e. '💡Reason' feature (inside the Tools button).  

> Pro Tip :
> We can use Emoji for naming the 'Chat Title' e.g. '👨‍💻Coding', '🎼Music research🎶', '🎹Piano learning', so that it will be more visually scannable and presentable.  

In upcoming lessons we will learn how to use the above features.  

🔸 Also, ChatGPT have the feature to updated/improved/refine our reponse if we don't like the present reply by ChatGPT.  

----










#### 🔰Lesson 4 : Get precision/user-focused reply with **'Customize ChatGPT'**  
There is a huge different between the reply given by the normal 'ChatGPT' and the 'Customize ChatGPT' which will be more specific to us, because in 'Customize ChatGPT' we are pre-defining ourself first before starting with prompting, so in this case AI will able to know more about us and then give response accordingly to us. (present in Setting's options to enable it || Not Paid feature)  

Through this feature we don't need to explain ourself a no. of times to GPT, it's more like "everything set, just prompting, get reply, start implementing".  

So, in 'Customize ChatGPT' we first need to fill/provide the following settings/details :  
- [x] What should ChatGPT call you? (means just to provide our name or e.g. Sir, Mr. _, etc.)  
- [x] What do you do? (means to provide our occupation OR what i want to do now)  
- [x] What traits should ChatGPT have? (means need to define the level of the reply (ease/professional/lamen's terms, stey-by-step manner, detail manner, simple english only, short responses, organize reponse in SWOT analysis, bullet point manner, assist me like J.A.R.V.I.S. assistant😁, etc.) or what quality should the GPT reply to us)
- [x] Anything else ChatGPT should know about you? (mean here we can mention any of our personal extra quality or the way we want the replies from ChatGPT)
- [ ] ChatGPT capabilities. (means enable/disable required AI features)

This is where we teach ChatGPT about us once with custom instructions, and then we never have to mention it again in the conversation repeatedly, and we expect all the replies will be on this pre-defined things.  
> The interesting thing is that, if we don't understand anything from the above like : where to give what information then for this also we can ask ChatGPT in a different new chat. 

<br>
<br>


<h5 align="center">Memory feature of ChatGPT (path : <i>profile icon > Settings > Personalization > Memory</i>)</h5>
'Memory' is a feature in ChatGPT, where it remembers all our important details from our earlier chats/conversations e.g. our goals, what we are doing, what we'll going to do, what our plans, what is our profession, etc. And we have option to enable or disable it for our replies, and also if we want we can delete/edit-update/reset these memories from the list. But thsi feature won't works in Temporary chats.  

We can also tell ChatGPT what to keep in memory while chating in a conversation.  

> Now in an existing chat, if we want ChatGPT should reply normaly or in default behaviour, then we can command it like *`forget/ignore previous chat/instructions and respond normally`* or we can start a new chat or we can use Temporary chat also.

#### 🔰Lesson 5 : Effective prompting and prompt structuring for effective results [**Attach PDF]  
Crafting an effective prompt is a skill that leads to prompt engineering. We can see some examples of crafting beautiful pormpts :   
- *`What hotels are in Paris.`*  
VS  
*`You are a travel advisor who specializes in helping travelers find unique and high value hotel stays.  
I'm planning a trip to Paris with my partner, and we're looking for a boutique style hotels in lively, walkable neighborhoods with great food nearby.  
We care both about comfort and experience, not just price. Please recommend five hotels in Paris that fit these preferences.  
Format your answers as a numbered list with 1 to 2 sentences describing each hotel only include hotels under $400 per night that offer amenities like a rooftop patio, gym or pool and are within walking distance of restaurants.  Describe each option in a concise and captivating manner.  
Here's an example of what I'm looking for a stylish boutique hotel near the Latin Quarter with a rooftop terrace. Known for its cozy vibe and incredible city views.`*
<br>


📌 Basically here we can follow 6 essential procedure/aspect/elements while prompting i.e. : **ROLE**, **CONTEXT**, **INSTRUCTIONS**, **FORMATTING**, **BOUNDARIES**, **EXAMPLE**. Now based on this if we try to craft a prompt then it looks like :  
- ROLE (AI's persona) : *`You are a writing coach who helps creatives craft compelling personal bios.`* (or act like _)  
- CONTEXT (audience's details) : *`I'm a freelance photographer transitioning into brand storytelling. I've worked with wellness brands and startups, and I want my bio to reflect creativity, collaboration, and trust.`*  
- INSTRUCTIONS (command) : *`Write a short bio for my website's about page.`*  
- FORMATTING (response format) : *`Keep it to one paragraph under 60 words.`*  
- BOUNDARIES (behaviour) : *`Use a warm, confident tone - avoid sounding formal or generic.`*  
- EXAMPLE (reference) : *`Use this as a style reference : "I help brands tell better stories - with strategy, emotion, and clean visuals. If it feels real, I'm in."`*


Now if we combine the above prompts, then it will be like : *`You are a writing coach who helps creatives craft compelling personal bios. I'm a freelance photographer transitioning into brand storytelling. I've worked with wellness brands and startups, and I want my bio to reflect creativity, collaboration, and trust. Write a short bio for my website's about page. Keep it to one paragraph under 60 words. Use a warm, confident tone - avoid sounding formal or generic. Use this as a style reference : "I help brands tell better stories - with strategy, emotion, and clean visuals. If it feels real, I'm in."`*.  

And we need to be very **used to** to this format of writing a prompt, then it'll be easier to understand why these elements are more effective. So this is just the first part of the anatomy of a great prompt, later we'll go more depth into it.

#### 🔰Lesson 6 : Identification/Symptom of good prompting & prompt crafting guideline 
Let's see make some good prompts by using above 6 essential elements :

VS  
*`I want you to act as a marketing specialist for a new fitness app made for busy moms.  The goal is to boost signups and downloads in the first 30 days.  Suggest three creative campaigns under $500.  Format it as a numbered list with 1 to 2 sentence descriptions.  Use warm and a supportive tone that speaks to overwhelmed moms in this scenario, and I want you to model the tone after this example, which is no time, no problem.  Quick workouts and real results. You've got this.`*
