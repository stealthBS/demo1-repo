  - Can do '🔍Search chat' or search any old chat conversation quickly.

  - Can 'Archive chat' or can hide any chat from the main active conversation list/tab or 'Chats' list.
  - Can create our own 'Customized ChatGPT' (PersonalizedGPT), and this feature's path is inside Setting's 'Personalization' tab. But we can directly access it by clicking on the profile icon.  
  - Can access many ready-made pre-built [GPTs](https://chatgpt.com/gpts) versions inside ChatGPT which are built by other peoples or organizations. And if we bookmarks any of these GPTs tools then it will appears in the sidebar. It contains different ready-made GPTs for different works like SEO, content creating, coding, etc. But only **Paid** users can able to make this type of GPTs.

  - And inside the chatbox only we can :  
    - Ask anything in the prompt box through typing.  
    - Ask anything through voice by clicking on '🎤Dictate' but, which actually works like speech-to-text.  
    - Toggle/Enable '🎙Voice mode' to activate fully voice-based conversation only, in which ChatGPT also talks backs with us. It's actually 'Voice chat' or can say interactive chat. It also keep track or record/history of chat/conversation. So, it's just works like any virtual/voice assistant e.g. Google Assistant or Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri.

> Pro Tip :
> We can use Emoji for naming the 'Chat Title' e.g. '👨‍💻Coding', '🎼Music research🎶', '🎹Piano learning', so that it will be more visually scannable and presentable.  

In upcoming lessons we will learn how to use the above features.  

🔸 Also, ChatGPT have the feature to updated/improved/refine our reponse if we don't like the present reply by ChatGPT.

#### 🔰Lesson 4 : Get precision/user-focused reply with **CustomizedGPT**  
There is a huge different between the reply given by the normal 'ChatGPT' and the 'Customized ChatGPT' (CustomizedGPT) which will be more specific to use, because in 'Customized ChatGPT' we are pre-defining ourself first before starting with prompting, so in this case AI will able to know more about us and then give response accordingly to us. (present in Setting's options to enable it || Not Paid feature)  

Through this feature we don't need to explain ourself a no. of times to GPT, it's more like "everything set, just prompting, get reply, start implementing".  

So, in CustomizedGPT we first need to fill/provide the following settings/details :  
- [x] What should ChatGPT call you? (means just to provide our name)  
- [x] What do you do? (means to provide our occupation OR what i want to do now)  
- [x] What traits should ChatGPT have? (means need to define the level of the reply (ease/professional/lamen's term) or what quality should the GPT reply to us)
- [x] Anything else ChatGPT should know about you? (mean here we can mention any of our personal extra quality)
- [ ] ChatGPT capabilities. (means enable/disable required AI features)
