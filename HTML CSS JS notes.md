<h2 align="center">HTML</h2>


In this section we will going to build 'Web app' instead of 'Website', and for this we use frontend technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  

And the difference between 'website' and 'web app' is that : a 'website' can't manipulate data or it just used to display contents only e.g. college website, whereas 'Web app' can able to manipulate data e.g. Facebook which suggest friends to us, Google search engine helps to search data, Youtube, Tax calculator, etc. So, Front-end technologies (i.e. browser side programmings) are also known also Client side programming/code. 

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes directly executes/runs in any modern browser engine, so it doesn't required any extra IDE tool & compiler as like we use for Java codes execution.  

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes are used to create GUI (Graphical User Interface) purpose in a web application.

- HTML code gives the basic skeleton structure to a web app GUI page.

- CSS code used for designing & styling the HTML structure for presentation.

- JavaScript code used to add restrictions & validations (for user data inputs) limiations in GUI page. For example like : "Amount entered in the input-box (field) shouldn't be greater than 200", and if we enter the amount greater than 200 then the browser won't accept the value or amount. 

- HTML codes have pre-defined HTML tags, so we need to remember these tags names and then we can able to use accordingly to our needs. Basically we have to understand this, and after that we can simply do cut-copy-paste editing work.  

The following is the basic structure/hierarchy/architecture/template of a HTML page :
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Welcome</title>
    </head>
    <body>


    </body>
</html>
```

<br>

Now let's see some examples : 
```html

```

Result or the output of the above HTML code looks like :
![web browser output]( "")


- `<h1></h1>` tag is used for page header, and similarly there are upto `<h6></h6>` tags.
- There are 3 popular ways/techniques/methods to use CSS code out of many others, i.e. :
    - [x] 'Inline CSS' code with HTML code (uses `style=""` attribute),
    - [ ] 'Internal (Embedded) CSS' code with HTML code (uses `<style></style>` tag), and
    - [ ] 'External CSS' code in seperate .css file.  

- So, here we use the 'Inline CSS' method, in which `style=""` attribute integrate CSS style in a basic way. 

- In HTML code we do commenting like `<!-- comment -->`, and this same comment syntax we used to comment in XML file as well as HTML file also. Commenting in any code helps to classify the codes easily, so that if other programmers looks our code it gives them readability. And brower engine neglects to execute Comment, it just used for educating other people.
