To maintain super-set and sub-set, we can write like this : 
- asdfaf
  - asdfasf
    - asdfasdf
      - asdf
====

for example to add an image here is :  
• first upload the image to this repository,  
• then use its link here like :  
e.g.  
![My Chess cat](https://github.com/stealthBS/demo1-repo/blob/main/assets/my%20chess%20cat.png)  

or 

![My Chess Cat](assets/my%20chess%20cat.png "If in same repository")  

or

<img src="assets/my%20chess%20cat.png" alt="My Chess Cat" width="500" title="can also resize image"/>



<br>


```java
A a1 = new A(); // can keep coding notes here
```

<br>

can make tables :  
| column 1 | column 2 |
| --- | --- |
| asdf | asdf `asdf` |

so we can make or **`keep`** notes *`like`* this also.

<h2 align=center>Linux CLI</h2>

Non-root user command looks like :  
```command
~$ sudo apt-get update
~$ sudo apt-get install python3
```  

<br>

Root user command looks like :  
```super_user
~# adduser sammy
~# shutdown
```
<br>
Basically whatever navigation works & operatings we do in Windows by using mouse (i.e. copy-paste-folder opening-selecting-etc.), here in Linux same thing we'll do but in terminal panel/tab with commands. And similarly there are more Linux specific operations for which also we use some special commands.  

Operating a PC with CLI or commands causes : No more GUI/interface load task to the PC, where everything will be operated from a single terminal panel/tab only.  


<br>
<br>

Both Linux and Windows have a concept of normal users and privileged users (commonly referred to as "root" in Linux and "administrator" in Windows).  

Suppose we have two PCs: one with Windows installed and a single user account, and another with Kali Linux installed, also with a single user account.  

In both systems, when using the terminal or command line, there are two types of user modes available: normal user mode and elevated (privileged) user mode.  

In Windows, this corresponds to a standard user and an administrator (admin) user.  

In Kali Linux, this corresponds to a normal user and the root user.  

If we are using Kali linux's terminal as normal user, then to switch to root user we use the command : `sudo su`.  
If we are suing Windows's command prompt as normal user, then we can't switch directly but can do like : **'cmd' >> Run as administrator**.

Let's see how to make take programming notes with step-by-step :  

##### Step 1
And here we can start writing about this step :
