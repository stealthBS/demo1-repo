#### ‚úÖEarly Sleep to Early WakeUp schedule
Help to wakeup in Brahma Muhurta, help to recovery from *Nocturnal emission* as deepest REM sleep stages ('drooling of saliva' type sleep or restorative sleep stages) not happening here, day feels like long so get enough time to do work. (As deepest REM sleep not happeninng here, so early morning wakeup may effect the "morning wood" i.e. *Nocturnal penile tumescence* -- for this it's better for us to **switch** this wakeup pattern time-to-time like 'sometime early' and 'sometime late').  

| Time | Description | Frequency | Jarvis assistant alert |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| 9 PM (OR) 9:15 AM | Sleep alert start | Everyday  | - Good night! Sir, go to sleep, you have to wake up early in the morning.<br>- 8:30pm Mosquito Net ON<br>- 8:15pm |
| ~~4 AM~~ (OR) 5 AM | Wake Up     | Everyday  | - Good morning! Sir<br>- 4:30am<br>- 5:00am<br>- **Make it 8 hours sleep**. |
| ~~5 AM~~ (OR) 5:30 AM | Workout-1   | Everyday  | Activate & alert both body & mind (Cardio, Kegal, Abs, Own body lifting workout or Calisthenics) |
| 10:30 AM | SunExposure & walking | Everyday | - It's time to get some natural VitalminD for 15min & and get rid from body's circadian confusion<br>- It's time to move otherwise you'll fall asleep soon.<br>- It helps to get rid from : Fatigue, tiredness, brain/mental fogginess, Hair loss like issues. |
| 11 AM | Workout-2 | Everyday  | - Before bath workout for body activation & alert mode<br>- Avoid sleepy, foggy mind, slackness, sluggishness, drowsiness, lethargic, drain and tired, etc. to make any excuse. |
| 11:30 AM | Bath ~~& Bursh~~ | Everyday | - Sir it's time to fresh up & be active for next some hours for productivity<br>- Go a take a bath qickly no matter what, otherwise you'll going to sleep soon and destroy the whole day. |

| 5 PM | Workout-3 | EveryDay | - It's time to do a final Cardio/Abs/Kegel workout before sleep |

- Sir! there's no point to continuing sleeping anymore.
- Waking up early doesn't means sleeping less or compromising with sleep and live a boring/struggled/tired day, it means sleep 8 hours or as much as you want, but wakeup early in the morning without feeling sleepy any more. So here we need to sleep too early to wake up too early, that simple it's, it required more discipline and need to have more control on social media & screentime.
- IN THIS CASE : If we don't have habit of early morning wakingup, then if we are sleeping for 7 hours, we need 8 hours duration of sleep, so that in 1st 1 Hour we will feeling sleep or going to sleep or struggle to fall asleep, and the remaining 7 hours we'll be actual sleeping, and this counts 7 hours of sleep. And in the morning the body will automatically get up without any lazziness and feels more energetic/recovered/Fuelled-up. [Here, the sleeping hours based on 8-8-8 Rule]  
- Sunlight exposure for vitaminD before bathing is consider more safer choice. But 30min to 2hrs also recommended to wait after the sunlight exposure so that vitaminD get absorb in a good amoount.
- If feel sleepy in daytime, then for alertness can play any high-stimulus game e.g. IGI series, etc.  
- Alert types :
  - Jarvis assistance - don't you want. . .
  - Sergent Drill instructor roar. . .da*n, f*ck, Lasisis, AAVE English,  
  - The Sacred War (any Soviet Union) & music box & LoFi
  - ASMR healing Temple Bell Meditation
  - Prabhupada Hare Krishna chants themes
  - Japanese themes // Kiki's food delivery // Ghibli style
- Sites to generate voice alarms : there's a .txt file follow that in the PC . . . . .  
- **Always remember discipline is the main key**.
- And the '72 Rule' üòÅ is used to estimate how long it will take for an investment to double at a fixed annual rate of return.
